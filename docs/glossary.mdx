    greatly improving development time from visual design to application deployment.

**[App Generator](https://appseed.us/generator/)**

    An app generator, also known as an application generator or code generator, is a software tool or platform that automates the process of creating software applications or specific components of an application. 
    It generates code, configuration files, and sometimes even user interfaces based on predefined templates, rules, and input provided by the user or developer.

**[Angular](/content/what-is/angular/) (Free Samples Included)**

    Angular, commonly referred to as "Angular" or "AngularJS," is an open-source front-end web application framework primarily maintained by Google and a community of developers. 
    It is designed to help developers build dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) and complex web interfaces. 

## B

**Bun**

    Bun is an all-in-one JavaScript runtime & toolkit designed for speed, complete with a bundler, test runner, and Node.js-compatible package manager.

**[Bootstrap](/content/what-is/bootstrap/)**

    Bootstrap is an open-source front-end framework that simplifies the process of designing and developing responsive and visually appealing web applications and websites.
        
## C

**[CentOS](/content/what-is/centos/)**

    CentOS (Community Enterprise Operating System) was a popular Linux distribution that was based on the open-source code of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). 

**C++**

    C++ is a general-purpose programming language that extends the C programming language with features for object-oriented programming (OOP). 
    It was developed as an enhancement of the C language by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s. 
    C++ is known for its versatility and is used for a wide range of applications, including systems programming, game development, scientific computing, embedded systems, and more.

## D

**[Django](/content/what-is/django/)**

    Django is a high-level, open-source web framework written in Python that enables developers to build web applications quickly and with a clean, pragmatic design.

**[DeployPRO](https://deploypro.dev/)**

    A service that aims to simplify the deployment process, empowering businesses to deploy, monitor, and scale applications without the burden of infrastructure complexities.
    Works with AWS, Digital Ocean, Azure and GCP (soon). 

**[Django App Generator](https://app-generator.dev/django/)**

    Free service that collects the users input (design, models, extended user definition) and uploads the source code automatically on GitHub (public repository).

## H

**[HTMX](/content/what-is/htmx/)**

    HTMX is a JavaScript library that allows you to build web applications with modern, dynamic user interfaces while keeping the server-side rendering and simplicity of traditional web development. 
    It's often used in conjunction with HTML, Python, and other server-side technologies.

## M

**[Multitenancy](/content/what-is/multitenancy/)**

    Multitenancy is a software architecture or model where a single instance of an application or software system serves multiple tenants or clients. 
    Each tenant is a separate and distinct group of users who share common access to the same system, but with their data and configuration kept isolated from other tenants.

**[Multitenancy in Django](/technologies/django/multitenancy/)**

    Multitenancy can be implemented in Django, a popular Python web framework, using various techniques and approaches. 
    Django provides a flexible environment that allows you to design and build multitenant applications.

**[Multitenancy in Flask](/technologies/flask/multitenancy/)**

    Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework that allows you to implement multitenancy in your web applications. 
    Like in Django, there are several approaches to implement multitenancy in Flask.

**[Multitenancy in NodeJS](/technologies/nodejs/multitenancy/)**    

    Implementing multitenancy in a Node.js application involves designing your codebase and database schema to support multiple tenants, each with its data and configurations.

## N

**[NodeJS](/content/what-is/nodejs/)**

    Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. 
    It is designed for building scalable and high-performance network applications, particularly server-side web applications. 
    Node.js is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O (input/output) model, which makes it well-suited for handling asynchronous operations and real-time applications. 

**NPM** 
  
    NPM, which stands for "Node Package Manager," is the default package manager for Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime environment. 
    NPM is a command-line tool and an online registry of open-source JavaScript packages and libraries. 
    It is used for managing, installing, and sharing reusable code packages and dependencies for Node.js applications.

**[NextJS](/content/what-is/next-js/)**

    Next.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building web applications. 
    It is primarily used for building React-based web applications but extends React's capabilities with features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and routing, making it well-suited for a wide range of web development projects. 
    Next.js simplifies many aspects of web development, offering a more structured and efficient development experience.

## P

**[PHP](/content/what-is/php/)**

    PHP, which stands for "Hypertext Preprocessor," is a widely used open-source scripting language designed for web development.

## R

**[React](/content/what-is/react/)**

    React, often referred to as React.js or ReactJS, is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) or user interface components for web applications. 
    It was developed and is maintained by Facebook (now Meta Platforms, Inc.) and a community of individual developers and companies. 
    React is widely used for creating interactive and dynamic web applications.

**[React App Generator](/content/what-is/react-app-generator/)**

    A React app generator is a software tool or platform designed to automate the process of creating React-based web applications. 
    React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and React app generators help developers set up the initial project structure, generate boilerplate code, 
    and provide a foundation for building React applications more efficiently.

## S

**[Simpllo](https://www.simpllo.com/)**

    Simpllo is an open-source site builder that helps anyone to create landing pages and websites on top of modern UI Kits - actively supported by AppSeed.

**SSR** 

    SSR stands for Server-Side Rendering, a technique used in web development to improve the performance and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) of web applications. 
    SSR is often associated with JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular, which are primarily designed for client-side rendering (CSR)

## V 

**Virtual DOM**

    The Virtual DOM (Virtual Document Object Model) is a concept and technique used in web development, particularly in libraries like React, 
    to improve the efficiency and performance of updating the user interface (UI) of web applications. 
    The Virtual DOM is not a real, physical representation of the web page's structure but rather a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual Document Object Model (DOM) tree.
