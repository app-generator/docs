# Flask Apps

<SubHeading>A curated list with all Flask Applications generated by AppSeed (not dashboards). </SubHeading>

All products listed on this page are generated on top of a simple [Flask Codebase](../../boilerplate-code/starters/flask.mdx) enhanced with authentication, database, ORM, and deployment scripts. Compared to dashboard products, the common codebase is much simple without [blueprints](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/blueprints/). 

> Products

- [Flask Boilerplate Code](../../boilerplate-code/starters/flask.mdx) - the reference code used for all Flask Apps
- [Flask Material Kit](material-kit.mdx) - open-source Flask starter
- [Flask Pixel Lite](pixel-lite.mdx) - open-source product

## Codebase Features

The codebase is fairly simple and was provided like this intentionally to help beginners (and not only) start faster a new Flask project. Here is the list with all features already implemented:

- UI Ready - the design is already `production-ready`
- Render engine: Jinja2 (Flask native engine)
- SQLite database, Flask-SQLAlchemy ORM
- Session-Based auth flow (login, register)
- Deployment scripts: Docker, Gunicorn / Nginx, Heroku
