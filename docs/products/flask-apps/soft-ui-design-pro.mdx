## Environment

To use the starter, [Python3](https://www.python.org) should be installed properly in the workstation. 
If you are not sure if Python is installed, please open a terminal and type `python --version`. Here is the full list with dependencies and tools required to build the app:

- [Python3](https://www.python.org) - the programming language used to code the app
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com) - used to clone the source code from the Github repository
- Basic development tools (g++ compiler, python development libraries ..etc) used by Python to compile the app dependencies in your environment.
- (Optional) `Docker` - a popular virtualization software

<br />

## Start in `Docker`

> ðŸ‘‰ **Step 1** - Download the [code](https://appseed.us/product/soft-ui-design-pro/flask/) and unzip the sources (requires a `purchase`).

```bash
$ # Get the code
$ unzip flask-soft-ui-design-pro.zip
$ cd flask-soft-ui-design-pro
```

> ðŸ‘‰ **Step 2** - Start the APP in `Docker`

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```

Visit `http://localhost:5085` in your browser. The app should be up & running.

<br />

## Manual Build

> Download the [code](https://appseed.us/product/soft-ui-design-pro/flask/) and unzip the sources (requires a `purchase`).

```bash
$ # Get the code
$ unzip flask-soft-ui-design-pro.zip
$ cd flask-soft-ui-design-pro
```

### ðŸ‘‰ Set Up for `Unix`, `MacOS`

> Install modules via `VENV`

```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

> Set Up Flask Environment

```bash
$ export FLASK_APP=run.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
```

> Start the app

```bash
$ flask run
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### ðŸ‘‰ Set Up for `Windows`

> Install modules via `VENV` (windows)

```
$ virtualenv env
$ .\env\Scripts\activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

> Set Up Flask Environment

```bash
$ # CMD
$ set FLASK_APP=run.py
$ set FLASK_ENV=development
$
$ # Powershell
$ $env:FLASK_APP = ".\run.py"
$ $env:FLASK_ENV = "development"
```

> Start the app

```bash
$ flask run
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

<br />

## Manage App `Users`

By default, the starter is not provided with users.

### ðŸ‘‰ Create Users

By default, the app redirects guest users to authenticate. In order to access the private pages, follow this set up:

- Start the app via `flask run`
- Access the `registration` page and create a new user:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/register`
- Access the `sign in` page and authenticate
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/login`
