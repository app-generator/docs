## âœ… Environment

To use the starter, [Python3](https://www.python.org) should be installed properly in the workstation. 
If you are not sure if Python is installed, please open a terminal and type `python --version`. Here is the full list with dependencies and tools required to build the app:

- [Python3](https://www.python.org) - the programming language used to code the app
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com) - used to clone the source code from the Github repository
- Basic development tools (g++ compiler, python development libraries ..etc) used by Python to compile the app dependencies in your environment.
- (Optional) `Docker` - a popular virtualization software


## âœ… Start with `Docker`

> ðŸ‘‰ **Step 1** - Download the code from the GH repository (using `GIT`)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/django-black-dashboard-pro.git
$ cd django-black-dashboard-pro
```

> ðŸ‘‰ **Step 2** - Start the APP in `Docker`

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```

Visit `http://localhost:5085` in your browser. The app should be up & running.


## âœ… Manual Build 

> ðŸ‘‰ Download the code  

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/django-black-dashboard-pro.git
$ cd django-black-dashboard-pro
```

<br />

> Export `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the environment. The value is provided by AppSeed during purchase. 

This is required because the project has a private REPO dependency: `github.com/app-generator/priv-django-admin-black-pro`

```bash
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN='TOKEN_HERE'  # for Linux, Mac
$ set GITHUB_TOKEN='TOKEN_HERE'     # Windows CMD
$ $env:GITHUB_TOKEN = 'TOKEN_HERE'  # Windows powerShell 
```

> ðŸ‘‰ Install modules via `VENV`.


```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ðŸ‘‰ Edit the `.env` using the template `.env.sample`. 

```env

# True for development, False for production
DEBUG=True

```

> ðŸ‘‰ Set Up Database

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

> ðŸ‘‰ Create the Superuser

```bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

> ðŸ‘‰ Start the app

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. 


## âœ… Manage App `Users`

By default, the starter is not provided with users. To access the private pages and the admin section (reserved for `superusers`) follow up the next sections.

### ðŸ‘‰ Create `Superusers`

To access the `admin` section, Django requires `superuser` privilegies. Let's create a new `superuser` and access the `admin` section of the project:

```bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Once the `superuser` is successfully created, we can access the `admin` section:

`http://localhost:8000/admin/`


## âœ… Codebase structure

The project is coded using a simple and intuitive structure presented below:

```bash
< PROJECT ROOT >
   |
   |-- core/                            
   |    |-- settings.py                  # Project Configuration  
   |    |-- urls.py                      # Project Routing
   |
   |-- home/
   |    |-- views.py                     # APP Views 
   |    |-- urls.py                      # APP Routing
   |    |-- models.py                    # APP Models 
   |    |-- tests.py                     # Tests  
   |    |-- templates/                   # Theme Customisation 
   |         |-- includes                # 
   |              |-- custom-footer.py   # Custom Footer      
   |     
   |
   |-- requirements.txt                  # Project Dependencies
   |
   |-- env.sample                        # ENV Configuration (default values)
   |-- manage.py                         # Start the app - Django default start script
   |
   |-- ************************************************************************
```


## âœ… How to Customize 

When a template file is loaded in the controller, `Django` scans all template directories starting from the ones defined by the user, and returns the first match or an error in case the template is not found. 
The  theme used to style this starter provides the following files: 

```bash
# This is saved in ENV: LIB/admin_black_pro
< UI_LIBRARY_ROOT >                   

   |
   |-- templates/                    # Root Templates Folder 
   |    |          
   |    |-- accounts/       
   |    |    |-- login.html          # Sign IN Page
   |    |    |-- register.html       # Sign UP Page
   |    |
   |    |-- includes/       
   |    |    |-- footer.html         # Footer component
   |    |    |-- sidebar.html        # Sidebar component
   |    |    |-- navigation.html     # Navigation Bar
   |    |    |-- scripts.html        # Scripts Component
   |    |
   |    |-- layouts/       
   |    |    |-- base.html           # Masterpage
   |    |    |-- base-auth.html      # Masterpage for Auth Pages
   |    |
   |    |-- pages/       
   |         |-- index.html          # Index Page (presentation)
   |         |-- settings.html       # Settings  Page
   |         |-- dashboard.html      # Dashboard page
   |         |-- *.html              # All other pages
   |    
   |-- ************************************************************************
```

When the project requires customization, we need to copy the original file that needs an update (from the virtual environment) and place it in the template folder using the same path. 

> For instance, if we want to **customize the footer.html** these are the steps:

- âœ… `Step 1`: create the `templates` DIRECTORY inside the `home` app
- âœ… `Step 2`: configure the project to use this new template directory
  - `core/settings.py` TEMPLATES section
- âœ… `Step 3`: copy the `footer.html` from the original location (inside your ENV) and save it to the `home/templates` DIR
  - Source PATH: `<YOUR_ENV>/LIB/admin_black_pro/includes/footer.html`
  - Destination PATH: `<PROJECT_ROOT>home/templates/includes/footer.html`

> To speed up all these steps, the **codebase is already configured** (`Steps 1, and 2`) and a `custom footer` can be found at this location:

`home/templates/includes/custom_footer.html` 

By default, this file is unused because the `theme` expects `footer.html` (without the `custom_` prefix). 

In order to use it, simply rename it to `footer.html`. Like this, the default version shipped in the library is ignored by Django. 

In a similar way, all other files and components can be customized easily.
