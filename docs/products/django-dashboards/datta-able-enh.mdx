## âœ… Environment

To use the starter, [Python3](https://www.python.org) should be installed properly in the workstation. 
If you are not sure if Python is installed, please open a terminal and type `python --version`. Here is the full list with dependencies and tools required to build the app:

- [Python3](https://www.python.org) - the programming language used to code the app
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com) - used to clone the source code from the Github repository
- Basic development tools (g++ compiler, python development libraries ..etc) used by Python to compile the app dependencies in your environment.
- (Optional) `Docker` - a popular virtualization software


## âœ… Codebase Structure

The project structure is simple to understand and intuitive enough as presented below:
