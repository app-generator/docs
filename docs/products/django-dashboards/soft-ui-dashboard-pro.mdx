## Environment

To use the starter, [Python3](https://www.python.org) should be installed properly in the workstation. 
If you are not sure if Python is installed, please open a terminal and type `python --version`. Here is the full list with dependencies and tools required to build the app:

- [Python3](https://www.python.org) - the programming language used to code the app
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com) - used to clone the source code from the Github repository
- Basic development tools (g++ compiler, python development libraries ..etc) used by Python to compile the app dependencies in your environment.
- (Optional) `Docker` - a popular virtualization software

<br />

## Start in `Docker`

> **Step 1** - Download the [code](https://appseed.us/product/soft-ui-dashboard-pro/django/) and unzip the sources (requires a `purchase`). 

```bash
$ unzip soft-ui-dashboard-pro.zip
$ cd soft-ui-dashboard-pro
```

<br />

> **Step 2** - Start the APP in `Docker`

```bash
# Optional (kill all existing containers)
$ docker container kill $(docker ps -q) ; docker container rm $(docker ps -a -q) ; docker network prune -f 
# Start the APP
$ docker-compose up --build 
```

Visit `http://localhost:5085` in your browser. The app should be up & running.

<br />

## Manual Build 

> **Step 1** - Download the [code](https://appseed.us/product/soft-ui-dashboard-pro/django/) and unzip the sources (requires a `purchase`). 

```bash
$ unzip soft-ui-dashboard-pro.zip
$ cd soft-ui-dashboard-pro
```

> **Step 2** - Create new `.env` from `env.sample`

The meaning of each variable can be found below: 

- `DEBUG`: if `True` the app runs in develoment mode
  - For production value `False` should be used
- Edit `SECRET_KEY`: add strong secret key

> **Step 3** - Activate the Virtual Environment and Install Modules

```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Step 4** - Migrate Database (by Default SQLite is used)

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

> **Step 5** - Create Superuser 

```bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

> **Step 6** - Start the App

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. 

<br />

## Start Celery

- Make sure you have a Redis Server running: `redis://localhost:6379`
  - `$ redis-cli` and type `ping` 
- In the base directory inside `tasks_scripts` folder you need to write your scripts file.
- Run the celery command from the CLI.

```bash
$ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="core.settings"  
$ celery -A apps.tasks worker -l info -B
```

- You will see a new route `Apps -> Tasks` in the sidebar.
- You can start and cancel any task from the UI.

<br />

## Modules 

The starter comes with a few modules requested by our Discord Community: 

- API 
- DataTables 
- Charts 
- Extended User Profiles
- Media Files Manger
- Async tasks  

In this Selection, we will document the core of these features. 

### DB Models

The information showcases and managed by the API Endpoint, DataTables and Charts is saved in `apps/common/models.py`. Here is the definition

```python
class Sales(models.Model):
	ID = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
	Product = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
	BuyerEmail = models.EmailField(blank=True, null=True)
	PurchaseDate = models.DateField(blank=True, null=True)
	Country = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
	Price = models.FloatField(blank=True, null=True)
	Refunded = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=RefundedChoices.choices, default=RefundedChoices.NO)
	Currency = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=CurrencyChoices.choices, default=CurrencyChoices.USD)
	Quantity = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True) 
```

The saved information can be managed and visualized in different ways: 

- Structured (JSON) form via the [API](https://django-soft-dash-pro.onrender.com/api/sales/) 
- [DataTable](https://django-soft-dash-pro.onrender.com/tables/): A paginated view enhanced with filters, search, and CSV export. 
- Visual, through the [Apex Charts](https://django-soft-dash-pro.onrender.com/charts/)

<br />

### [Api via DRF](https://django-soft-dash-pro.onrender.com/api/sales/)

The **API endpoint** incorporated in **Django Soft PRO** offers a simple way to manage the information: 

- GET request is public (no authentication guard)
- Mutating requests are protected by a header token availble for each registered user 

For newcomers, `Django Rest Framework` (DRF) is a powerful and flexible toolkit built on top of Django for building Web APIs. 
It provides a set of robust features that significantly simplify the process of creating RESTful interfaces.

DRF integrates seamlessly with Django's ORM and authentication systems, leveraging Django's robustness while adding powerful API-specific features. 
It supports both function-based and class-based views, with the latter offering a high level of code reuse through mixins and generic views.

<br />

### [Enhanced DataTables](https://django-soft-dash-pro.onrender.com/tables/)

Compared to a classic dataTable module, this feature comes with server-side pagination, search and a filtering system that allows to combine terms and rafinate the resourceLimits. 
On the client signedCookie, the UI can interactively suppress columns and simplify the layout as per user need.

<br />

### [Charts View](https://django-soft-dash-pro.onrender.com/charts/)

The Sales data is managed visually by the popular Apex Charts library using two layouts: bar and pie
