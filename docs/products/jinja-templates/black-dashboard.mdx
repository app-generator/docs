# Jinja Black Dashboard

<SubHeading>Jinja Template starter generated by the AppSeed platform on top of Black Dashboard (free version)</SubHeading>

**Jinja Template** project generated by AppSeed on top of **Black Dashboard** (free version), a popular design crafted by Creative-Tim. The project is a super simple Flask project WITHOUT database, ORM, or any other hard dependency. The starter can be used as a codebase for a future project or to migrate the **Jinja** files and assets to a legacy Python-based project that uses Jinja as the template engine (Flask, Bottle, Django).

> Features:

- Codebase: [Jinja Starter](../../boilerplate-code/boilerplate-jinja.mdx)
- Render Engine: Flask / **Jinja2**
- Deployment scripts: Docker, Gunicorn/Nginx, HEROKU

## What is Jinja

[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modeled after Django’s templates. It is fast, widely used, and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution environment. Jinja is basically an engine used to generate HTML or XML returned to the user via an HTTP response.
