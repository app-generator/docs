# Jinja Black Dashboard

<SubHeading>Jinja Template starter generated by the AppSeed platform on top of Black Dashboard (free version)</SubHeading>

**Jinja Template** project generated by AppSeed on top of **Black Dashboard** (free version), a popular design crafted by Creative-Tim. The project is a super simple Flask project WITHOUT database, ORM, or any other hard dependency. The starter can be used as a codebase for a future project or to migrate the **Jinja** files and assets to a legacy Python-based project that uses Jinja as the template engine (Flask, Bottle, Django).

> Features:

- Codebase: [Jinja Starter](../../boilerplate-code/jinja.mdx)
- Render Engine: Flask / **Jinja2**
- Deployment scripts: Docker, Gunicorn/Nginx, HEROKU

## What is Jinja

[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modeled after Djangoâ€™s templates. It is fast, widely used, and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution environment. Jinja is basically an engine used to generate HTML or XML returned to the user via an HTTP response.
