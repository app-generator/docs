<br />

## âœ… Quick Start

This project uses includes a Blog system that uses Prismic CMS. You'll need a free [prismic.io](http://prismic.io/) account.

<br />

## âœ… Setup Prismic CMS

- In your Prismic account, create a new repository.
- In your repository, create a repeatable custom type called Blog Posts with API ID "blogposts".
- To configure the content model for Blog Posts, paste this code in the JSON editor of the Blog Posts content type.

  ```
  {
    "Main": {
      "title": {
        "type": "StructuredText",
        "config": {
          "single": "heading1, heading2, heading3, heading4, heading5, heading6",
          "label": "title",
          "placeholder": "Title of the article"
        }
      },
      "uid": {
        "type": "UID",
        "config": {
          "label": "uid",
          "placeholder": "ID of the article"
        }
      },
      "date": {
        "type": "Date",
        "config": {
          "label": "date",
          "placeholder": "Created date of the article"
        }
      },
      "article_image": {
        "type": "Image",
        "config": {
          "constraint": {},
          "thumbnails": [],
          "label": "article_image"
        }
      },
      "body": {
        "type": "StructuredText",
        "config": {
          "multi": "paragraph,preformatted,heading1,heading2,heading3,heading4,heading5,heading6,strong,em,hyperlink,image,embed,list-item,o-list-item,rtl",
          "allowTargetBlank": true,
          "label": "Body of the Article",
          "placeholder": "Article Body"
        }
      }
    }
  }

  ```

- Add a bunch of content to the Blog Post. This is the data 11ty will use to build your site blog.
- Find your API endpoint in your repository settings, you will need it when you're setting up your local project and Netlify deploy.

<br />

## âœ… Local Development

- After setting up `Prismic CMS`, Generate a new repo from this repository template which will copy this project into your own new repo.
- Open the terminal, Clone your new repository with `git clone <https://github.com/YOUR_REPO`>,
- Navigate to the newly created repo and, and run "npm install" to install all dependencies.
- Rename the ".env.sample" file (located in the root directory) to ".env" and edit the file to add your Prismic repository API endpoint.
- Run "npm run start" to start a development server or "npm run build" to build your site.

<br />

## âœ… Deploy to Netlify

- Upload the local repository you set up to Github.
- Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/). Once youâ€™ve logged in, click the 'New site from Git' button and choose the forked repository you just created.
- Follow the prompts, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard when the build is complete.
- When you get to deploy & build settings, you need to add your Prismic repository API endpoint as an environmental variable named PRISMIC_REPOSITORY_NAME

## âœ… SetUP Netlify build HOOK 

We need to set up a webhook so that when you save a Prismic document, this triggers a Netlify build.

> Go to your Netlify site settings and add a webhook under Build & deploy, you'll get a URL that triggers the webhook:

## âœ… Customization

> **CSS**

Styling can be written in Sass. The main index file is in `src/static/assets/styles/main.scss`. Import any SCSS code you want in there; it will be processed and optimized. 
The output is in `dist/static/assets/styles/main.css`

> **JS**

Javascript can be written in ES6 syntax. The main index file is in `src/static/assets/scripts/main.js`. It will be transpiled to ES5 with babel, bundled together with webpack, and minified in production. 
The output is in `dist/static/assets/scripts/main.js`

> **Global Data Files**

You can update the global data like title, meta description of the site at `src/data/meta.json`
