## Environment

To use the starter, [Python3](https://www.python.org) should be installed properly in the workstation. 
If you are not sure if Python is installed, please open a terminal and type `python --version`. Here is the full list with dependencies and tools required to build the app:

- [Python3](https://www.python.org) - the programming language used to code the app
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com) - used to clone the source code from the Github repository
- Basic development tools (g++ compiler, python development libraries ..etc) used by Python to compile the app dependencies in your environment.
- (Optional) `Docker` - a popular virtualization software


## Start the app in Docker

> ðŸ‘‰ **Step 1** - Download the code from the GH repository (using `GIT`)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/django-soft-ui-design.git
$ cd django-soft-ui-design
```

> ðŸ‘‰ **Step 2** - Start the APP in `Docker`

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```

Visit `http://localhost:5085` in your browser. The app should be up & running.


## Manual Build

> Download the code

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/django-soft-ui-design.git
$ cd django-soft-ui-design
```


### ðŸ‘‰ Set Up for `Unix`, `MacOS`

> Install modules via `VENV`

```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

> Set Up Database

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

> Start the app

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.


### ðŸ‘‰ Set Up for `Windows`

> Install modules via `VENV` (windows)

```
$ virtualenv env
$ .\env\Scripts\activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

> Set Up Database

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

> Start the app

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.


## Manage App `Users`

By default, the starter is not provided with users. To access the private pages and the admin section (reserved for `superusers`) follow up the next sections.

### ðŸ‘‰ Create `Superusers`

To access the `admin` section, Django requires `superuser` privilegies. Let's create a new `superuser` and access the `admin` section of the project:

```bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Once the `superuser` is successfully created, we can access the `admin` section:

`http://localhost:8000/admin/`


## Codebase structure

The project is coded using a simple and intuitive structure presented below:

```bash
< PROJECT ROOT >
   |
   |-- core/                            
   |    |-- settings.py                  # Project Configuration  
   |    |-- urls.py                      # Project Routing
   |
   |-- home/
   |    |-- views.py                     # APP Views 
   |    |-- urls.py                      # APP Routing
   |    |-- models.py                    # APP Models 
   |    |-- tests.py                     # Tests  
   |    |-- templates/                   # Theme Customisation 
   |         |-- pages                   # 
   |              |-- custom-index.html  # Custom Index      
   |     
   |-- requirements.txt                  # Project Dependencies
   |
   |-- env.sample                        # ENV Configuration (default values)
   |-- manage.py                         # Start the app - Django default start script
   |
   |-- ************************************************************************
```


## How to Customize 

When a template file is loaded, `Django` scans all template directories starting from the ones defined by the user, and returns the first match or an error in case the template is not found. 
The theme used to style this starter provides the following files: 

```bash
# This exists in ENV: LIB/theme_soft_design
< UI_LIBRARY_ROOT >                      
   |
   |-- templates/                     # Root Templates Folder 
   |    |          
   |    |-- accounts/       
   |    |    |-- sign-in.html         # Sign IN Page
   |    |    |-- sign-up.html         # Sign UP Page
   |    |
   |    |-- includes/       
   |    |    |-- footer.html          # Footer component
   |    |    |-- navigation.html      # Navigation Bar
   |    |    |-- scripts.html         # Scripts Component
   |    |
   |    |-- layouts/       
   |    |    |-- base.html            # Masterpage
   |    |
   |    |-- pages/       
   |         |-- index.html           # Dashboard Page
   |         |-- author.html          # Profile Page
   |         |-- *.html               # All other pages
   |    
   |-- ************************************************************************
```

When the project requires customization, we need to copy the original file that needs an update (from the virtual environment) and place it in the template folder using the same path. 

> For instance, if we want to **customize the index.html** these are the steps:

- âœ… `Step 1`: create the `templates` DIRECTORY inside the `home` app
- âœ… `Step 2`: configure the project to use this new template directory
  - `core/settings.py` TEMPLATES section
- âœ… `Step 3`: copy the `index.html` from the original location (inside your ENV) and save it to the `home/templates` DIR
  - Source PATH: `<YOUR_ENV>/LIB/theme_soft_design/template/pages/index.html`
  - Destination PATH: `<PROJECT_ROOT>home/templates/pages/index.html`

> To speed up all these steps, the **codebase is already configured** (`Steps 1, and 2`) and a `custom index` can be found at this location:

`home/templates/pages/custom-index.html` 

By default, this file is unused because the `theme` expects `index.html` (without the `custom-` prefix). 

In order to use it, simply rename it to `index.html`. Like this, the default version shipped in the library is ignored by Django. 

In a similar way, all other files and components can be customized easily.


## Deploy on [Render](https://render.com/)

- Create a Blueprint instance
  - Go to https://dashboard.render.com/blueprints this link.
- Click `New Blueprint Instance` button.
