# Django Apps

<SubHeading>A curated list with all Django Applications generated by AppSeed (not dashboards).</SubHeading>

All products listed on this page are generated on top of a simple [Django Codebase](../../boilerplate-code/starters/django.mdx) enhanced with authentication, database, ORM, and deployment scripts.&#x20;

> Products

- [Django Boilerplate Code](../../boilerplate-code/starters/django-dashboard.mdx) - the reference code used for all Flask Apps
- [Django Pixel Lite](pixel-lite.mdx) - open-source product

### Codebase Features

The codebase is fairly simple and was provided like this intentionally to help beginners (and not only) start faster a new Flask project. Here is the list with all features already implemented:

- UI Ready - the design is already `production-ready`
- SQLite Database, Django Native ORM
- Session-Based Authentication, Forms validation
- Deployment scripts: Docker, Gunicorn/Nginx
