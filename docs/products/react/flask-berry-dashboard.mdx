# [Flask React Berry](https://appseed.us/product/berry-dashboard/api-server-flask/react/)

<SubHeading> Open-source Full Stack seed project built in React and Flask on top of Berry Dashboard </SubHeading>

`Full-Stack` Seed project generated by [React App Generator](https://appseed.us/generator/react/) top of **[Berry Dashboard](https://appseed.us/product/berry-dashboard/api-server-flask/react/)** design. 
The backend logic is provided by a simple, `easy-to-extend` **Flask API Server** that manages the Authentication flow (login, registration, logout) using `JSON Web Tokens` (JWT). 
The **React** Design is crafted by [CodedThemes](https://codedthemes.com/?ref=appseed) on top of `MUI` Library.

## Product features

The product expects a running API backend that exposes an interface for login/logout and register actions. 
By default, the guest users are redirected to the login page. Once the user is authenticated using an existing account or the new one, all private pages are accessible.

- **Auth**: JWT tokens managed via `Flask-jwt_extended`
- [API Definition](https://docs.appseed.us/boilerplate-code/api-unified-definition) - the unified API structure implemented by this server


## ✨ How to use it

Being a full-stack product, the backend and the frontend should be compiled and started separately. 
Before starting to compile the product, make sure you have the following tools installed in the environment:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - version `14.x` or higher
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) - used to clone tjhe sources from Github
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/) - used in many tools


### 👉 Start the Frontend 

> **Step 1** - Once the project is downloaded, change the directory to `react-ui`. 

```bash
$ cd react-ui
```

> **Step 2** - Install dependencies via NPM or yarn

```bash
$ npm i
// OR
$ yarn
```

> **Step 3** - Start in development mode

```bash
$ npm run start 
// OR
$ yarn start
```

At this point, the app is available in the browser `localhost:3000` (the default address).


### 👉 Start the Backend Server 

> **Step 1** - Change the directory to `api-server-flask`

```bash
$ cd api-server-flask
```

> **Step 2** - Install dependencies using a `virtual environment`

```bash
$ # Virtualenv modules installation (Unix based systems)
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$
$ # Virtualenv modules installation (Windows based systems)
$ # virtualenv env
$ # .\env\Scripts\activate
$
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


> **Step 3** - Setup the `Flask` environment 

```bash
$ export FLASK_APP=run.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
// OR 
$ (Windows CMD) set FLASK_APP=run.py
$ (Windows CMD) set FLASK_ENV=development
// OR
$ (Powershell) $env:FLASK_APP = ".\run.py"
$ (Powershell) $env:FLASK_ENV = "development"
```


> **Step 4** - Start the API server (development mode)

```bash
$ flask run
```

Use the API via `POSTMAN` or `Swagger Dashboard` at `localhost:5000`.


### 👉 Start API using `Docker` 

> **Step 1** - Change the directory to `api-server-flask`

```bash
$ cd api-server-flask
```


> **Step 2** - Start API using `docker-compose` command 

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```
