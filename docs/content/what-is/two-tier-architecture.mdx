# Two-Tier Architecture

<SubHeading>Short introduction to Two-Tier Architecture</SubHeading>

Two-tier architecture, also known as two-layer architecture or client-server architecture, is a software architecture model that divides an application into two distinct parts or tiers: 
the client tier and the server tier. Each tier has specific responsibilities and functions within the overall application, and they communicate with each other to provide the desired functionality.

> Here are the **key components and characteristics of a two-tier architecture**:

## âœ… **Client Tier** 

This tier represents the user interface or client-side of the application. It is responsible for presenting the application's user interface to the end-users and collecting user inputs. 
The client tier typically runs on the user's device, such as a desktop computer, mobile device, or web browser. It may include components like user interfaces, presentation logic, and user input handling.

## âœ… **Server Tier** 

The server tier, also known as the backend or server-side, handles the application's core logic, data processing, and data storage. 
It responds to requests from the client tier, processes those requests, interacts with databases, and generates responses. 
The server tier can run on a remote server or a cloud-based infrastructure, separate from the client devices. It typically includes components like application servers, business logic, and databases.

## âœ… **Communication** 

Communication between the client and server tiers occurs over a network, usually through well-defined protocols such as HTTP, TCP/IP, or custom application-specific protocols. 
The client sends requests to the server, which processes them and returns the appropriate responses.

## âœ… **Data Flow** 

In a two-tier architecture, data flow is often bi-directional. 
Clients send requests to the server, which processes these requests, interacts with databases or other data sources if necessary, and sends back the results or responses to the client.

## âœ… **Responsibilities** 

The client tier focuses on presenting information to users and collecting their inputs, while the server tier manages data processing, business logic, security, and data storage. 
The division of responsibilities between the tiers helps maintain separation of concerns and modularity in the application.

## âœ… **Scalability** 

Two-tier architectures can scale vertically (by adding more resources to a single server) or horizontally (by adding more servers) to handle increased traffic or workload. 
However, scaling may be limited by the capabilities of the server hardware.

## âœ… **Examples** 

Traditional desktop applications, where the client runs on a user's computer and communicates with a central server, are classic examples of two-tier architectures. 
Additionally, web applications with a client-side user interface (e.g., web browser) and a server-side backend are another common example.

## âœ… In Summary

Two-tier architectures are relatively straightforward and can be well-suited for simple applications where the client's responsibilities are mainly presentation and user input, 
and the server handles most of the application's logic and data processing. 

However, they may face limitations in terms of scalability and flexibility as applications grow in complexity or need to accommodate a large number of users. 
In such cases, more advanced architectures like three-tier or n-tier architectures are often preferred.
