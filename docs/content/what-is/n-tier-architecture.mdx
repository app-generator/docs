# N-Tier Architecture

<SubHeading>Short introduction to Multi-Tier Architecture</SubHeading>

Multi-tier architecture (often referred to as n-tier architecture) or multilayered architecture is a client–server architecture in which presentation, application processing, 
and data management functions are physically separated. Using an N-tier architecture, web developers can create modular applications.

## ✅ Common layers

In a multilayered architecture the most common used layers are:

- Presentation layer - the visual part of a web application
- Application layer - the server-side of a web application
- Database layer - the persistence layer where information is saved and updated

## ✅ Presentation layer

This layer handles the user interaction. This part of the application is usually built-in HTML and Javascript in various technologies and frameworks:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - the popular Javascript framework built by Facebook
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) 

## ✅ Application layer

Represents the server-side of the application and can be developed in many programming languages:

- [Php](https://www.php.net/) (the most popular server-side language ) using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [CodeIgniter](https://www.codeigniter.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) server-side apps can be developed using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

## ✅ Database layer

The majority of web apps requires a type of storage to save the relevant data:

- [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/) - the popular open-source database engine
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) - the lite version of MySql
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - a document-based engine

## ✅ Common Architectures

In web development the most used architectures are:

## ✅ Single Tier architecture

The web application is served only once by the server, and runs entirely on the client-side

## ✅ Two Tier architecture

Sometimes named Full-Stack architecture
