# What IS Jinja

<SubHeading>Short introduction to Jinja</SubHeading>

[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) is a popular templating engine for Python web applications. It is used primarily in web frameworks like Flask and Django to generate dynamic HTML, XML, or other markup documents. 
Jinja templates allow developers to embed Python-like expressions and logic directly within HTML or other template files, enabling the dynamic generation of content to be displayed in a web application.

![What IS Jinja - Tutorial provided by AppSeed.](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/51070104/269188380-4c7aa7ac-88e8-480a-b428-240ab3616a30.jpg) 

> Key **features and characteristics of Jinja** include:

## âœ… **Expression Interpolation** 

Jinja allows you to embed Python expressions inside template files using double curly braces, like `{{ variable_name }}`. 
These expressions are evaluated, and their results are inserted into the template when it's rendered.

## âœ… **Control Structures** 

You can use control structures such as `if` statements, `for` loops, and `macro` definitions in Jinja templates. 
This allows for conditional rendering of content and iteration over data collections.

## âœ… **Template Inheritance** 

Jinja supports template inheritance, where you can define a base template with common structure and placeholders for content. 
Subtemplates can then extend the base template and fill in the content placeholders.

## âœ… **Filters and Functions** 

Jinja provides a variety of filters and functions that allow you to manipulate and format data within templates. 
For example, you can use filters to format dates, convert text to lowercase, or perform other transformations.

## âœ… **Custom Macros** 

You can define custom macros in Jinja templates to encapsulate reusable pieces of HTML or logic. These macros can be included in multiple templates.

## âœ… **Autoescaping** 

Jinja includes an autoescaping feature to help prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. 
It automatically escapes potentially unsafe data by default but allows developers to mark content as safe if necessary.

Here's a basic example of a Jinja template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>{{ page_title }}</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome, {{ user_name }}!</h1>
    
    <ul>
        {% for item in shopping_cart %}
            <li>{{ item }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, `{{ page_title }}`, `{{ user_name }}`, and `{% for item in shopping_cart %}` are Jinja template expressions and control structures.

## âœ… In Summary

Jinja's simplicity and flexibility make it a popular choice for web developers working with Python-based web frameworks. 
It separates the logic from the presentation layer, making it easier to maintain and modify web templates.
