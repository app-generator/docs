# What is Next.js

<SubHeading>Next.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building modern web applications.</SubHeading>

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an open-source JavaScript framework for building modern web applications. 
It is primarily designed for building React-based web applications but adds several powerful features on top of React to enhance the development experience and performance. 

![What is Next.js - Tutorial provided by AppSeed.](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/51070104/270271822-7d508468-319c-4576-90d3-45e6a54a16d4.jpg) 

**Next.js** is often used for server-rendered applications, static websites, and single-page applications (SPAs).

> Here are some **key features and concepts associated with Next.js**:

## ✅ **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** 

Next.js supports server-side rendering out of the box. SSR improves page load times and SEO because pages are generated on the server and sent as HTML to the client. 

This is particularly beneficial for content-heavy or dynamic websites.

## ✅ **Static Site Generation (SSG)** 

In addition to SSR, Next.js provides static site generation. You can generate fully static websites where pages are pre-rendered at build time, resulting in extremely fast loading times.

## ✅ **Routing** 

Next.js includes a file-based routing system. You create pages by adding `.js` or `.tsx` files to the `pages` directory, and Next.js automatically sets up routes based on the file structure.

## ✅ **Data Fetching** 

Next.js offers several data fetching methods, including `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and `getStaticPaths`, to fetch data for your pages. 

These methods allow you to control when and how data is fetched during rendering.

## ✅ **Automatic Code Splitting** 

Next.js automatically splits your JavaScript code into smaller chunks, so only the code needed for a particular page is sent to the client. 

This improves performance by reducing initial load times.

## ✅ **API Routes** 

You can create serverless API routes with Next.js using the `pages/api` directory. These routes enable you to handle HTTP requests and create RESTful or GraphQL APIs.

## ✅ **CSS Support** 

Next.js provides flexibility in how you manage CSS. You can use CSS modules, styled-components, Sass, or any other CSS-in-JS or CSS pre-processing solution.

## ✅ **Hybrid Applications** 

Next.js allows you to build hybrid applications by combining SSR, SSG, and client-side rendering (CSR). 

This flexibility enables you to choose the rendering strategy that best suits each part of your application.

## ✅ **TypeScript Support** 

Next.js has built-in TypeScript support, making it easy to write statically typed code and catch errors early in development.

## ✅ **Deployment** 

Next.js applications can be deployed to various hosting providers and platforms, including Vercel, Netlify, and traditional cloud providers like AWS and Heroku.

## ✅ **Extensibility** 

You can extend Next.js functionality through custom plugins, middleware, and webpack configurations to meet the specific requirements of your project.
