# What IS PNPM

<SubHeading>Short introduction to PNPM, a popular open-source package manager for JavaScript.</SubHeading>

[PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) (pronounced "pin-pm") is an open-source package manager for JavaScript and Node.js applications. 
It is designed to manage project dependencies efficiently while addressing some of the limitations and challenges associated with other package managers like npm (Node Package Manager) and Yarn. 

![What IS PNPM - Tutorial provided by AppSeed.](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/51070104/269238582-ee5e1528-ab9b-467e-8b5e-3d7ab9ea4be9.jpg) 

PNPM is particularly known for its approach to dependency management, which involves shared and linked dependencies.

> Here are some **key features and aspects of PNPM**:

## ✅ **Shared Dependencies** 

One of the defining features of PNPM is its use of shared dependencies. 
Instead of duplicating packages in each project's `node_modules` directory, PNPM stores a single copy of each package in a global store. 

This approach reduces disk space usage and speeds up installation times, especially when multiple projects share common dependencies.

## ✅ **Linking Dependencies** 

PNPM creates symbolic links (or hard links on Windows) from the project's `node_modules` directory to the global store, allowing projects to access shared dependencies as if they were locally installed. 
This reduces the overhead of copying or downloading the same package multiple times.

## ✅ **Deterministic** 

PNPM uses a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to ensure deterministic and consistent dependency resolution. 
This means that when you install dependencies for a project, PNPM ensures that the same versions of packages are used across different installations, reducing the likelihood of dependency conflicts.

## ✅ **Concurrent Installs:** 

Like Yarn, PNPM supports concurrent (parallel) package installations, taking advantage of multiple network connections and CPU cores to speed up the installation process.

## ✅ **Offline Mode** 

PNPM has an offline mode that allows you to install packages without an internet connection, making it suitable for development in environments with limited connectivity.

## ✅ **Workspaces** 

Similar to Yarn, PNPM supports workspaces, which makes it easier to manage multiple packages within a single repository. This is beneficial for monorepos and multi-package projects.

## ✅ **Cross-Platform** 

PNPM is cross-platform and can be used on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## ✅ **Custom Registries** 

PNPM allows you to specify custom package registries, making it suitable for organizations with private package repositories.

## ✅ **Maturity and Adoption** 

PNPM has gained traction within the JavaScript and Node.js community and is used in various projects. It has matured over time and has an active community of users and contributors.

## ✅ In Summary

While PNPM offers several advantages, it's important to note that it may require some adjustment in development workflows compared to traditional package managers like npm. 
Developers and teams can choose to use PNPM based on their specific needs, project requirements, and preferences for managing JavaScript dependencies.
