> Here are some key features and characteristics of Bulma CSS:

## âœ… **Responsive Design** 

Bulma is built with mobile-first responsive design principles, which means that web pages created with Bulma will adapt and look good on a wide range of devices, 
including smartphones, tablets, and desktops, without the need for extensive custom CSS.

## âœ… **Flexbox-Based** 

Bulma relies heavily on the CSS Flexbox layout model. This makes it easy to create complex and flexible page layouts with a minimal amount of code.

## âœ… **Modular and Extensible** 

Bulma's design is modular, meaning that it is organized into reusable CSS classes that you can apply to your HTML elements. 
This modularity makes it easy to customize and extend the framework to suit your specific project requirements.

## âœ… **SASS Support** 

Bulma can be integrated with SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets), a popular CSS preprocessor, to further enhance the maintainability and organization of your stylesheets.

## âœ… **Documentation** 

Bulma comes with comprehensive documentation that provides examples, explanations, and usage guidelines for each CSS class and component. 
This documentation makes it easy for developers to get started with the framework.

## âœ… **Customization** 

While Bulma provides a default set of styles, it's designed to be customized easily to match your project's unique design requirements. You can use variables to change colors, fonts, and other design elements.

## âœ… **No JavaScript** 

Unlike some other CSS frameworks, Bulma is a pure CSS framework and does not rely on JavaScript for its core functionality. 
This can be an advantage if you want to minimize the use of JavaScript in your web projects.

## âœ… **Community and Ecosystem** 

Bulma has a growing and active community, which means there are many third-party extensions, themes, and plugins available to enhance your development experience.

## âœ… In Summary

To get started with Bulma, you can include its CSS file in your HTML document, and then you can start applying Bulma's classes to your HTML elements to create responsive and visually appealing layouts.

Overall, Bulma is a versatile CSS framework that can simplify the front-end development process and help you create attractive and user-friendly web interfaces.
