# What IS Angular

<SubHeading>All about Angular, a leading JS framework for coding interactive user interfaces.</SubHeading>

**[Angular](https://angular.io/)**, commonly referred to as "Angular," is an open-source front-end web application framework maintained by `Google` and a community of developers. 
It is designed for building dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) and complex web interfaces.

**Angular** provides a comprehensive set of tools and features for building both small and large-scale web applications.

> **Key features and characteristics of Angular** include:

## âœ… **Component-Based Architecture** 

Angular follows a component-based architecture where UI elements and functionality are organized into reusable components. 
Each component encapsulates its own logic, templates, and styles, making it easier to maintain and scale applications.

## âœ… **TypeScript** 

Angular is primarily built using TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript. 
TypeScript adds strong typing and advanced tooling, helping developers catch errors early and write more maintainable code.

## âœ… **Two-Way Data Binding** 

Angular offers two-way data binding, allowing automatic synchronization of data between the model (JavaScript objects) and the view (HTML templates). 
Changes in one are reflected in the other, simplifying the management of user interfaces.

## âœ… **Dependency Injection** 

Angular provides a powerful dependency injection system that makes it easier to manage and inject dependencies (services, components, etc.) into various parts of an application. 
This promotes modularity and testability.

## âœ… **Directives** 

Angular introduces custom HTML elements and attributes called directives that allow developers to extend the HTML language to add dynamic behavior and functionality to templates.

## âœ… **Routing** 

Angular includes a powerful routing module that enables developers to create navigation and manage views in SPAs. 
It supports deep linking, lazy loading, and route guards for controlling access to specific routes.

## âœ… **Forms** 

Angular offers a comprehensive set of tools for building forms, including template-driven forms and reactive forms (also known as model-driven forms). 
These tools simplify form creation, validation, and submission.

## âœ… **HTTP Client** 

Angular provides an HTTP client module for making HTTP requests to remote servers. It supports observables and allows developers to handle asynchronous data retrieval and updates.

## âœ… **Internationalization (i18n)** 

Angular supports internationalization and localization, making it possible to create applications in multiple languages and regions.

## âœ… **Testing** 

Angular includes testing utilities and supports various testing frameworks, making it easier to write unit tests and end-to-end tests for applications.

## âœ… **CLI (Command Line Interface)** 

Angular offers a command-line interface known as the Angular CLI, which simplifies project setup, code generation, and common development tasks.

## âœ… **Rich Ecosystem**

Angular has a large and active community, as well as a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries, tools, and extensions that extend its functionality.
