# What IS uWsgi

<SubHeading> Short introduction to uWSGI server and architecture</SubHeading>

[uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (pronounced "micro WSGI") is an application server and web server gateway interface (WSGI) server for serving Python web applications. 
It is a popular choice for deploying Python web applications and is widely used in production environments. 

![What IS uWsgi - Tutorial provided by AppSeed.](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/51070104/269224103-ea077c63-d4db-4f29-a7f0-25ac0155e894.jpg)

uWSGI is known for its performance, flexibility, and the ability to serve a variety of web frameworks and applications.

> Here are some **key features and characteristics of uWSGI**:

## âœ… **WSGI Compatibility** 

uWSGI is fully compliant with the WSGI standard, making it compatible with a wide range of Python web frameworks and applications, including Django, Flask, Pyramid, and more.

## âœ… **High Performance** 

uWSGI is designed for high performance and can handle a large number of concurrent requests. It supports various worker processes and threading models to optimize application performance.

## âœ… **Flexibility** 

uWSGI is highly configurable, allowing developers to fine-tune various aspects of the server, such as request routing, load balancing, and process management. 
It also supports plugins for extending its functionality.

## âœ… **Protocol Support** 

In addition to serving WSGI applications, uWSGI can handle other protocols, such as HTTP, FastCGI, and SCGI, making it versatile for various use cases.

## âœ… **Load Balancing** 

uWSGI can be used as a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple application instances or servers, improving reliability and scalability.

## âœ… **Application Containerization** 

uWSGI supports running applications in containers like Docker, making it suitable for containerized deployments and microservices architectures.

## âœ… **Monitoring and Management** 

uWSGI provides various tools and interfaces for monitoring and managing application instances, including a built-in stats server, command-line utilities, and integration with monitoring systems like Prometheus.

## âœ… **Security Features** 

uWSGI includes features for enhancing security, such as support for running applications in isolated environments, sandboxing, and privilege separation.

## âœ… **Ease of Deployment** 

uWSGI is relatively easy to set up and deploy. It can be configured using configuration files or command-line options.

## âœ… **Community and Documentation** 

uWSGI has an active community of users and contributors, and it offers extensive documentation and tutorials to help developers get started.

To deploy a Python web application using uWSGI, you typically configure uWSGI with the appropriate settings and then point it to your WSGI-compatible application or framework. Here's a simple example of running a Flask application with uWSGI:

```bash
uwsgi --http :8080 --wsgi-file myapp.py
```

In this example, `myapp.py` is the entry point of the Flask application, and uWSGI is configured to serve the application on port 8080.

## âœ… In Summary

Overall, **uWSGI is a versatile and performant option for deploying Python web applications**, and it is commonly used in conjunction with web servers like Nginx or Apache to serve web content to users.
