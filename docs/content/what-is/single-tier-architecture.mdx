# Single-Tier Architecture

<SubHeading>Short introduction to Single Tier Architecture</SubHeading>

Single-tier architecture, also known as single-tier model or monolithic architecture, 
is a traditional software architecture in which all the components of an application are combined into a single software module or codebase. 

In this architecture, the user interface (UI), application logic, and data storage are tightly integrated into a single executable or application.

> Key **characteristics of single-tier architecture** include:

## âœ… **All-in-One** 

In a single-tier architecture, the entire application, including the user interface, business logic, and data management, runs on a single machine or within a single software process. 
There is no separation between these components.

## âœ… **Simplified Development** 

Building and deploying applications in a single-tier architecture can be relatively straightforward. 
Developers write code that handles both the presentation and the application's core functionality in a single codebase.

## âœ… **Limited Scalability** 

Single-tier applications typically lack scalability because they run on a single machine. 
Scaling can be challenging and often requires manual efforts, such as upgrading hardware.

## âœ… **Limited Reusability** 

Components and functions in a single-tier architecture are tightly coupled, making it difficult to reuse code across different parts of the application or in other projects.

## âœ… **Maintenance Challenges** 

As the application grows, maintaining and updating code in a single-tier architecture can become complex and error-prone. 
Changes to one part of the application can impact other parts.

## âœ… **Resource Consumption** 

Single-tier applications may consume significant system resources, as all components are running on the same machine.

## âœ… In Summary

Single-tier architectures are typically found in small, simple applications or prototypes, where the development and maintenance overhead of more complex architectures is not justified.
They are also common in legacy systems that were developed before more modern and scalable architectural patterns became prevalent.

However, single-tier architectures have limitations that make them less suitable for larger, more complex, and scalable applications. 
As a result, modern software development tends to favor multi-tier architectures, such as two-tier (client-server), three-tier, or n-tier architectures, which separate the UI, application logic, 
and data management into distinct layers or tiers. 

These architectures offer better scalability, maintainability, and reusability of code and are more aligned with contemporary software development best practices.
