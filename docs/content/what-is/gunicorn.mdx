# What IS Gunicorn

<SubHeading>Short introduction to Gunicorn</SubHeading>

[Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) 'Green Unicorn' is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX. It's a pre-fork worker model. 
The Gunicorn server is broadly compatible with various web frameworks, simply implemented, light on server resources, and fairly speedy.

Gunicorn is one of many WSGI server implementations, but it's particularly important because it is a stable,
 commonly-used part of web app deployments that's powered some of the largest Python-powered web applications in the world, such as Instagram.

Gunicorn is based on a pre-fork worker model, compared to a worker model architecture. 
The pre-work worker model means that a master thread spins up workers to handle requests but otherwise does not control how those workers perform the request handling. Each worker is independent of the controller.
