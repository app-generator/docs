# What IS CentOS

<SubHeading>CentOS is a Linux distribution that provides a free, community-supported computing platform.</SubHeading>

[CentOS](https://www.centos.org/), which stands for "Community ENTerprise Operating System," was a Linux distribution that aimed to provide a free, open-source, and community-supported alternative to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). 
CentOS was developed by the CentOS Project and was known for its stability, security, and long-term support, making it a popular choice for server environments.

> Key **characteristics and points about CentOS** included:

## **Compatibility with RHEL** 

CentOS was built using the same source code that RHEL used. 
This meant that CentOS was largely binary-compatible with RHEL, allowing users to transition from CentOS to RHEL with minimal effort if they required commercial support from Red Hat.

## **Stability** 

CentOS was renowned for its stability and reliability. It had a reputation for being a robust and dependable operating system, which made it a favored choice for server deployments.

3. **Long-Term Support (LTS):** CentOS provided long-term support for its releases, typically for around a decade. This LTS model appealed to organizations seeking a stable platform for their infrastructure.

4. **Security Updates:** The CentOS Project regularly released security updates and patches to address vulnerabilities, ensuring the security of systems running CentOS.

5. **Community-Driven:** CentOS was a community-driven project, and it relied on contributions from volunteers and organizations. This allowed users to participate in its development and contribute to the project.

However, in December 2020, there was a significant change in the CentOS ecosystem. The CentOS Project announced a shift in focus for CentOS Linux from being a downstream RHEL rebuild to becoming an upstream development platform for RHEL. They introduced a new project called "CentOS Stream," which became the successor to CentOS Linux.

CentOS Stream is still a rolling-release Linux distribution, but it is positioned as a development preview of RHEL rather than a downstream clone. This change was met with mixed reactions in the community, as it impacted the long-term support and predictability that CentOS Linux had been known for.

Due to this shift, some users and organizations began exploring alternative Linux distributions, such as CentOS alternatives like Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux, which aimed to provide a more traditional CentOS-like experience with long-term support.

Please note that the information I've provided is accurate as of my last knowledge update in September 2021. The Linux landscape may have evolved since then, and I recommend checking the latest developments and the official websites of relevant projects for the most up-to-date information.
