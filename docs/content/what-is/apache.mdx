# What IS Apache

<SubHeading>Open-source high performance HTTP Server.</SubHeading>

The [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/), commonly referred to as Apache, is an open-source web server software developed and maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. 
It is one of the most widely used web server applications in the world and is known for its reliability, performance, and extensibility. 

![What IS Apache - Tutorial provided by AppSeed.](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/51070104/268982622-16ca9ced-0cc0-4228-9d36-bc424c87b9aa.jpg) 

Apache is often used to serve web content over the internet, making it accessible to users through their web browsers.

> Key features and characteristics of the Apache HTTP Server include:

## âœ… **Open Source** 

Apache is released under the Apache License, which is an open-source license. This means that anyone can use, modify, and distribute the software freely.

## âœ… **Cross-Platform** 

Apache is designed to run on various operating systems, including Unix-like systems (Linux, FreeBSD, etc.), Windows, macOS, and more. This cross-platform compatibility makes it versatile and widely adopted.

## âœ… **Highly Configurable** 

Apache can be extensively configured using configuration files, allowing administrators to tailor its behavior to specific needs. 
Configuration files are written in a format often referred to as the Apache Configuration Language.

## âœ… **Modular Architecture** 

Apache uses a modular architecture where functionality is added via loadable modules. This allows administrators to enable or disable features as needed, making the server lightweight and efficient.

## âœ… **Security Features** 

Apache provides a range of security features and modules to protect web applications and websites from common security threats. 
It supports SSL/TLS encryption, access control, and security headers, among other security measures.

## âœ… **Scalability** 

Apache is capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections and can be configured to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers in a load-balancing setup.

## âœ… **Support for Dynamic Content** 

Apache supports server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, and Perl, making it suitable for serving dynamic web content and applications.

## âœ… **Community Support** 

Apache has a large and active user and developer community, which means that there is a wealth of documentation, tutorials, and community support available for users and administrators.

## âœ… **Logging and Monitoring** 

Apache offers comprehensive logging capabilities, allowing administrators to track server activity and diagnose issues. It also integrates with various monitoring tools.

## âœ… **Virtual Hosting** 

Apache supports virtual hosting, enabling multiple websites to be hosted on a single server, each with its own configuration and domain name.

## âœ… In Summary

Apache's flexibility and robustness make it a popular choice for web hosting providers, enterprises, and individual developers for serving websites and web applications. 
Many popular web development stacks, such as LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl), use Apache as the web server component.
