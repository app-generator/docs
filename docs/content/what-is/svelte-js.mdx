# What IS Svelte

<SubHeading> Short introduction to Svelte</SubHeading>

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces (UIs) and web applications. 
It is designed to make front-end development more efficient by compiling components into highly optimized JavaScript code that runs in the browser. 

![What IS Svelte - Tutorial provided by AppSeed.](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/51070104/269228958-d1fbb1a5-d725-4d0b-9aed-2dcda115f7ee.jpg)

Svelte is known for its simplicity, performance, and innovative approach to building web applications.

> Here are some **key aspects and characteristics of Svelte**:

## **Compiler-Based Approach** 

Svelte takes a compiler-based approach to web development. 
Instead of shipping a large runtime library to the client's browser, Svelte compiles components into efficient JavaScript code during the build process. 

This results in smaller bundle sizes and faster load times for web applications.

## **Component-Based** 

Like other modern front-end frameworks, Svelte encourages a component-based architecture. You can create reusable UI components that encapsulate specific functionality and appearance.

## âœ… **Declarative Syntax** 

Svelte uses a declarative syntax similar to HTML to define components and their behavior. 
You write code that describes how the UI should look based on the application's state, and Svelte handles updating the DOM efficiently when the state changes.

## âœ… **Reactivity** 

Svelte introduces reactivity by automatically generating code to update the DOM when data changes. 
This is done without the need for manual event listeners or observers, making code concise and easier to reason about.

## âœ… **CSS** 

Svelte supports scoped CSS, allowing you to define styles for components without worrying about global scope or naming collisions.

## âœ… **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** 

Svelte can be used for server-side rendering, which improves the initial load time of web applications and provides better SEO (search engine optimization) capabilities.

## âœ… **Routing** 

While Svelte itself does not include a built-in router, you can use external routing libraries (e.g., SvelteKit) to handle client-side routing.

## âœ… **Small Bundle Sizes** 

Svelte's compiler optimizes the generated JavaScript code, resulting in smaller bundle sizes compared to some other frameworks. This is beneficial for performance and faster page loads.

## âœ… **Growing Ecosystem** 

Svelte has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools built by the community, including SvelteKit (a framework for building applications), Sapper (a legacy framework), and various Svelte-based UI component libraries.

## âœ… **Community and Adoption** 

Svelte has gained popularity in the front-end development community due to its simplicity and performance. 
It is used by individual developers and companies to build a wide range of web applications, including single-page applications (SPAs), progressive web apps (PWAs), and more.

## âœ… In Summary

Svelte's approach to front-end development simplifies the development process by reducing the amount of boilerplate code and runtime overhead typically associated with other frameworks. 
It has quickly gained traction among developers looking for an efficient and modern way to build web applications with a focus on performance and maintainability.
