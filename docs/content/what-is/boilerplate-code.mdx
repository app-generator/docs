# What IS Boilerplate Code

<SubHeading>Reusable software (boilerplate code) - a short introduction.</SubHeading>

In programming, **boilerplate code** is a piece of software that can be reused without changing much. 
The whole idea behind a starter (sometimes boilerplate code) is to skip coding that piece of code common to many projects.

- [Boilerplate Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) - Wikipedia page
- [Boilerplate Code](https://appseed.us/boilerplate-code) - page hosted by AppSeed

<br />

AppSeed workflow uses boilerplate code to generate usable, production-ready starters.

> Boilerplate code provided and actively supported by AppSeed:

- [Flask Dashboard Starter](https://github.com/app-generator/boilerplate-code-flask-dashboard) - database, ORM, Blueprints, and deployment scripts
