# What is NueJS

<SubHeading>Short introduction to NueJS, an alternative to React, Vue, and Svelte</SubHeading>

**[Nue JS](https://nuejs.org/docs/nuejs/)** is an extremely small (2.3kb minzipped) JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
It is the core of Nue toolset. Itâ€™s like Vue.js, React.js, or Svelte but there are no hooks, effects, props, portals, watchers, injects, suspensions, or other unusual abstractions on your way. 

## Build Interfaces with less code

The [React version](https://headlessui.com/react/listbox) is 2500 lines of JavaScript. Nue version is about ten times smaller even with 50-80% of the features:
