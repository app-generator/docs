### How to compile DashKit <a href="#how-to-compile-dashkit" id="how-to-compile-dashkit"></a>

Being a commercial product to get access to the source code please access the official page and purchase a license. Once you have the source code downloaded a [minimal programming kit](https://docs.appseed.us/content/tutorials/minimal-programming-kit) should be properly installed and accessible in the terminal.

- A modern editor - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)​
- ​[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - used in [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)-based products and tools
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - installed globally

Once all the tools are installed we can start compiling the code.

> **Step #1** - Change the directory inside the sources

```
$ cd dashkit-pro
```

> **Step #2** - Install modules via NPM or Yarn

```
$ npm install
// OR
$ yarn
```

> Step #3 - Compile the sources and generate the HTML files

```
$ gulp dev
```

Dashkit is now viewable at `http://localhost:3000`

If all goes well, we should see Dashkit PRO running in the browser.
