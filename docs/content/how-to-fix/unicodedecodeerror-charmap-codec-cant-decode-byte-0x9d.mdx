# UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x9d

<SubHeading>This page explains How to Fix UnicodeDecodeError: charmap codec can't decode byte 0x9d in position X: character maps to undefined</SubHeading>

This issue is environmental and might occur during package installation (via PIP) or simply at runtime when files are loaded and processed by Python. 

A fix that worked for a Windows OS with Python 3.9 was to force in the environment the UTF8 encoding:

```bash
$ set PYTHONUTF8=1 # For Windows CMD
```
