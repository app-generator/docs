# Cannot import name 'TextField' from 'wtforms'

<SubHeading>This page explains How to Fix ImportError: cannot import name 'TextField' from 'wtforms'</SubHeading>

[WTForms](https://pypi.org/project/WTForms/) is a flexible forms validation and rendering library for Python web development. 
It can work with whatever web framework and template engine you choose. It supports data validation, CSRF protection, internationalization (I18N).

![WTForms TextField import Error](https://github.com/app-generator/assets/assets/51070104/00f679e5-6dc4-4c44-a11b-056a205915bd)

## ✅ Error Text

```python
from wtforms import TextField
>> ImportError: cannot import name 'TextField' from 'wtforms'
```

The above error occurs when the `TextField` property is used with [WTForms](https://pypi.org/project/WTForms/) version 3.0 or above 
because the `wtforms.TextField` deprecated in favor of `wtforms.StringField`.

## ✅ How to Fix

> Solution 1 - Replace `TextField` type with `StringField`

Note: This solution works with WTForms 3.x and 2.x versions

```python
from wtforms import StringField
// replace all TextField usages with StringField type
```

> Solution 2 - Use the latest stable 2.x version of WTForms

```
// Use 2.x version
pip install WTForms==2.3.3
```

Using an older version provides a quick fix for your codebase but is not recommended in the long run.
