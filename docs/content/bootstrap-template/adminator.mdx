## How to compile the project

- A modern editor - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - used in [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)-based products and tools&#x20;
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) - a command-line tool used to download sources from [Github](https://github.com/)

Once we have all these tools accessible we can start compiling the product:

> **Step #1** - Clone the sources from the public repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/puikinsh/Adminator-admin-dashboard.git
$ cd Adminator-admin-dashboard
```

> Step #2 - Install modules via NPM or Yarn

```
$ npm install
// OR
$ yarn
```

> Step #3 - Start the app in development mode (with LIVE Reloading)

```

// OR
$ yarn dev
```

If all goes well, we should see the app running in the browser:
