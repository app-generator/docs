<SubHeading>Iconic Open-source Dashboard Template crafted by ColorLib</SubHeading>

**AdminLTE** is a popular open-source template for admin dashboards and control panels. 
It is a responsive HTML template that is based on the [Bootstrap CSS](https://www.admin-dashboards.com/bootstrap-5-templates/) framework.

- 👉 [AdminLTE Flask](https://appseed.us/product/adminlte/flask/) - `Flask` integration (free)
- 👉 [AdminLTE Django](https://appseed.us/product/adminlte/django/) - `Django` integration (free) 

It utilizes all of the Bootstrap components in its design and re-styles many commonly used plugins to create a consistent design that can be used as a user interface for backend applications. 
**AdminLTE** is based on a modular design, which allows it to be easily customized and built upon.
