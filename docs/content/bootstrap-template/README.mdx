**[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)** is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. 
It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

**Bootstrap** is a powerful toolkit - a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools for creating and building web pages and web applications. 
It is a free and open-source project, hosted on GitHub, and originally created by Twitter.
