<SubHeading>Open-source Bootstrap 5 UI Kit crafted by Creative Tim</SubHeading>

**Material Kit** is a free **Bootstrap 5** Kit with a fresh, new design inspired by Google's material design. 
Material Kit 2 is built with over 60 frontend individual elements, like buttons, inputs, navbars, nav tabs, cards, or alerts, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. 
All components can take variations in color, which you can easily modify using SASS files and classes.

**Material Kit** makes use of light, surface, and movement. It uses a deliberate color choice, edge-to-edge imagery, and large-scale typography. 
The general layout resembles sheets of paper following multiple different layers so that the depth and order is obvious. The navigation stays mainly on the left and the actions on the right.
