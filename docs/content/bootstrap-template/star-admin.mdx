Star Admin is packed with all the features that fit your needs but not cramped with components you would not even use. It is an excellent fit to build admin panels, e-commerce systems, project management systems, CMS or CRM.

## How to build the template

To build Star Admin in a local environment, NodeJs, Yarn and Gulp must be properly installed and accessible in the terminal:

- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) - command line versioning command
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - version 10.x or above
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - a modern package manager
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - installed globally.

if you're not sure if the required tools are already installed, open a terminal and type the following commands.

> Check NodeJs version/installation

```
$ node -v
v12.18.4
```

> Check Yarn version

```
$ yarn -v
1.22.5
```

> Install Gulp globally

```
$ npm install -g gulp-cli
```

After installation, we can check the Gulp version using `-v` argument.

```
$ gulp -v
CLI version: 2.3.0
```

Once the required tooling is accessible we can start compiling the Star Admin template.

> Step #1 - Clone/download Star Admin source code

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BootstrapDash/StarAdmin-Free-Bootstrap-Admin-Template.git
$ cd StarAdmin-Free-Bootstrap-Admin-Template
```

> Step #2 - Install modules (dependencies)

```
$ npm install
// OR
$ yarn
```

> Step #3 - Start the project

```
$ gulp
```

At this point, we can visit the app in the browser `http://localhost:3000`.
