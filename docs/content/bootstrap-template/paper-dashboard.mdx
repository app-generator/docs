**Paper Dashboard 2** is built on top of [Bootstrap](https://www.admin-dashboards.com/bootstrap-5-templates/), so it fully supports it. 
Most of the elements from the dashboard are re-designed to resemble sheets of paper and color pastels. If they are elements that we have not touched, they will gracefully fall back to the Bootstrap 4 default.
