# Migration Steps

## step 1 - Generate a new Docusaurus site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the classic template.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## step 2 - Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The cd command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The npm run start command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open docs/intro.md (this page) and edit some lines: the site reloads automatically and displays your changes.

## step 3 - copy documentation content from GitBook to docusaurus

1. First Navigate to docs folder and delee the generated tutorial docs from docusaurus ,
2. Navigate to gibook project folder copy all contents except .git and .gibook and move them to the docusaurus project under docs/
3. Convert all doc files from md to mdx extension
4. you will get this error "DocNavbarItem: couldn't find any doc with id "intro" in version current". Available doc ids are: ..""
   this is because the navbar is set to the previous deleted tutorial doc files in step 1.

   ### Solution

   go to docusaurus.config.js at the root of the project Edit themeConfig:navbar:items[0] change docId docId: "app-generator",
   to one of the available doc ids from the error above

5. Build the project run:

```bash
npm run build
```

# SSR

1. Create a ssr folder on the root of docusaurus project

2. Create file index.js inside ssr folder and add below code

```jsx title="/ssr/index.js"
const express = require("express");
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

// create express application
const app = express();

const distFolder = path.join(process.cwd(), "../build");

app.set("view engine", "html");
app.set("views", distFolder);

// app.get(
// 	"/appSeed//.(js|css|map|ico|svg|png|jpg|jpeg)$/",
// 	express.static(distFolder, {
// 		maxAge: "1y",
// 	})
// );
// serve static assets
app.get(/\.(js|css|map|ico|svg|png|jpg|jpeg|woff2)$/, express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, "../build")));

// for any other requests, send `index.html` as a response

app.get("/sitemap.xml", (req, res) => {
	let indexHTML = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, "../build/" + req.originalUrl), {
		encoding: "utf8",
	});

	// set header and status
	res.contentType("text/xml");
	res.status(200);

	return res.send(indexHTML);
});
app.get("/opensearch.xml", (req, res) => {
	let indexHTML = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, "../build/" + req.originalUrl), {
		encoding: "utf8",
	});

	// set header and status
	res.contentType("text/xml");
	res.status(200);

	return res.send(indexHTML);
});
app.get("/favicon.ico", (req, res) => {
	let indexHTML = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, "../build/" + req.originalUrl), {
		encoding: "utf8",
	});

	// set header and status
	res.contentType("png");
	res.status(200);

	return res.send(indexHTML);
});

app.use("*", (req, res) => {
	if (req.originalUrl.includes("assets")) return express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, "../build/" + req.originalUrl));
	console.log("url", req.originalUrl);
	// console.log("method", req.method);
	let indexHTML;
	// read `index.html` file
	if (req.originalUrl == "/") {
		indexHTML = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, "../build/index.html"), {
			encoding: "utf8",
		});
	} else {
		indexHTML = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, "../build/" + req.originalUrl + "/index.html"), {
			encoding: "utf8",
		});
	}

	// set header and status
	res.contentType("text/html");
	res.status(200);

	return res.send(indexHTML);
});

// run express server on port 9000
app.listen("9000", () => {
	console.log("Express server started at http://localhost:9000");
});
```

3. run the ssr version of the app after building project

```bash
node ssr/index.js
```
