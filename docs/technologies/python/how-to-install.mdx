# How to install Python

<SubHeading>Learn how to install Python on different platforms (MacOS, Windows, Ubuntu and CentOS), a step-by-step guide</SubHeading>

Python can be easily installed on these operating systems, and I'll walk you through the process for each one.

<br />

## âœ… Installing Python on MacOS

MacOS comes with a pre-installed version of Python 2.x. To install Python 3, you can follow these steps:

### **Open Terminal**

Go to the "Applications" folder, then open the "Utilities" folder, and finally, open the "Terminal" app.

### **Install Homebrew (if not already installed)**

If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by running the following command in the Terminal:

```bash
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### **Install Python 3**

Use Homebrew to install Python 3 by running:

```bash
$ brew install python@3
```

### **Verify Installation**

To check if Python 3 is installed, type:

```bash
$ python3 --version
```

<br />

## âœ… Installing Python on Windows

### **Download Python**

- Open a web browser and go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
- You will see the latest stable version of Python available for Windows. Choose the version you want to install. It's recommended to download the latest version (e.g., Python 3.8.7).
- Scroll down to the "Files" section and select the installer that matches your system architecture (usually 64-bit for modern systems).

### **Run the Installer**

Once the installer is downloaded, double-click on it to run it.

### **Configure Python Installation**

- Check the box that says "Add Python X.X to PATH" during installation (replace "X.X" with the version number).
- Click the "Customize installation" button if you want to customize the installation location or components. For most users, the default settings are fine.

### **Install Python**

Click the "Install Now" button to start the installation.

### **Verify Installation**

- Open the Command Prompt by searching for "cmd" or "Command Prompt" in the Start menu.
- Type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see the installed Python version.
