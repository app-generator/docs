# Python Site Generator

<SubHeading>Learn more about site generators in Python</SubHeading>

A Python site generator, often referred to as a "static site generator," is a tool used to create static websites. 
Unlike dynamic websites that generate content on the server for each visitor, static sites pre-generate all their pages and serve them as-is. 

This approach offers advantages in terms of performance, security, and simplicity.

Static site generators typically work by combining content, often written in markup or a lightweight templating language, with templates to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the website. 

Some popular **Python-Based static site generators** include:

## âœ… **Pelican**

[Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/) is a widely used static site generator that allows you to write content in Markdown, reStructuredText, or other formats and convert it into HTML.

- Sample generator:
```bash
pelican-quickstart
pelican content -o output -s pelicanconf.py
```

## âœ… **MkDocs**

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a simple static site generator focused on creating documentation websites. It allows you to write documentation in Markdown and automatically generates an attractive site.

- Sample generator:
```bash

## âœ… **Sphinx**

[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) is primarily used for generating documentation for Python projects, but it can be adapted for creating static sites. It uses reStructuredText and provides extensive customization options.

- Sample generator:

```

## âœ… **Nikola**

## âœ… In Summary

These are just a few examples of Python site generators. Depending on your specific requirements, you can choose the one that best fits your needs.
