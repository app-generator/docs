# Getting Started with Next.js

<SubHeading>Getting Started with Next.js, a leading web framework powered by React</SubHeading>

Getting started with Next.js is a great choice if you want to build modern and highly performant web applications with React. 
Next.js is a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications. 

![Getting Started with Next JS - Tutorial provided by AppSeed.](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/51070104/270271822-7d508468-319c-4576-90d3-45e6a54a16d4.jpg) 

It offers a streamlined development experience, automatic code splitting, and server-side rendering (SSR) out of the box. 

> Follow these **steps to get started with Next.js**:

## âœ… **Set Up Your Environment**

Before you start with Next.js, make sure you have the following tools installed on your computer:

- **Node.js**: You'll need Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

- **npm or Yarn**: npm (Node Package Manager) comes with Node.js, but you can also use Yarn, which is an alternative package manager. You can choose either one, but npm is included with Node.js.

## âœ… **Create a New Next Project**

To create a new Next.js project, you can use the `create-next-app` utility, which sets up a new Next.js project with all the necessary configurations. 

> Here's how to do it:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to create a new Next.js project:

   ```
   npx create-next-app my-next-app
   ```

   Replace `my-next-app` with your desired project name.

3. Navigate to your project directory:

   ```
   cd my-next-app
   ```

## âœ… **Start the Development Server**

Next, you'll start the development server to see your Next.js application in action:

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   or if you're using Yarn:

   ```
   yarn dev
   ```

2. Your Next.js development server will start, and you'll see a message indicating that your application is running on a specific port (usually 3000).

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a sample Next.js application with a "Welcome to Next.js" message.

## âœ… **Explore the Project Structure**

Next.js follows a specific project structure that helps you organize your code efficiently. Some of the key folders and files in a Next.js project include:

- `pages/`: This directory contains your application's pages. Each `.js` or `.tsx` file in this directory corresponds to a route in your application.

- `components/`: You can place your React components in this directory for reuse throughout your application.

- `styles/`: You can add your CSS or SCSS stylesheets here.

- `public/`: This directory is for static assets like images, fonts, and other files that are publicly accessible.

- `package.json`: This file contains the project's dependencies and scripts.

## âœ… **Customize Your Next.js Application**

You can now start customizing your Next.js application by editing the files in the `pages/` directory, adding components, and incorporating your own styles.

As you develop, you can leverage Next.js features like server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and routing to build dynamic and high-performance web applications.

## âœ… **Learn More and Explore Documentation**

Next.js offers many features and capabilities beyond the basics. To deepen your knowledge and explore more advanced topics, refer to the official Next.js documentation: https://nextjs.org/docs

## âœ… In Summary

The documentation covers topics like data fetching, API routes, deployment, dynamic routing, and more. 
Additionally, you can find tutorials and examples on the Next.js website to help you build specific types of applications and websites.
