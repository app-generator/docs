# Deploy Next.js on Netlify

<SubHeading>Learn how to prepare and deploy a Next.js application on Netlify.</SubHeading>

In the last document, we learned how to create a simple Next.js application. 
In this document, you will learn how to deploy a Next.js application on Netlify.

![Deploy Next.js on Netlify - Tutorial provided by AppSeed.](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/51070104/270271822-7d508468-319c-4576-90d3-45e6a54a16d4.jpg) 

## âœ… Configuring the Project

Before deploying the application, we must ensure that the Next.js application is ready for production. Let's start with optimizing the images for production. First, install the following packages:

```bash
yarn install next-compose-plugins next-optimized-images
```

The `next-compose-plugins` provides a simple API and modules to make Next.js plugin configurations easier. The `next-optimized-images` package will automatically optimize images used in this project.

In the `next.config.js` file, make sure to have the following configurations.

```js
const withPlugins = require("next-compose-plugins");
const optimizedImages = require("next-optimized-images");

const nextConfiguration = {
	target: "serverless",
	images: {
		disableStaticImages: true,
		optimizeImages: true,
	},
};

module.exports = withPlugins([optimizedImages], nextConfiguration);
```

After the configuration of the Next.js plugins, let's write the `netlify.toml` configuration file.

```toml
# netlify.toml
[build]
  command = "yarn build"
  publish = ".next"
```

In the code above, we specify the required commands and configuration for Netlify to build the project and where to publish the built project. To ensure the build will pass on Netlify, you can run the build command.

```bash
yarn build
```

if there is no error, the project is ready for deployment on Netlify.

## âœ… Deploying on Netlify

> We assume here that you have a Netlify account and that the project source code is hosted on a service like Github, Gitlab, etc.

First, add a new site. If your project is already available on an online code hosting service, choose the **import an existing project**.

![Screenshot 2022-08-22 at 23-27-53 Import an existing project from a Git repository Netlify.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1661208127511/mJV59cEgs.png) You will be redirected to the last configuration for the project such as the command and the output directory. No need to modify something here as we have already done it in the `netlify.toml` file. Validate and wait for the deployment. You can find an online version of this project [here](https://rococo-bienenstitch-ddae51.netlify.app/).

## âœ… In Summary

In this documentation, we quickly learned how to deploy a `Next.js` application on Netlify. In the next document, we will discuss best practices to follow when working with `Next.js`.
