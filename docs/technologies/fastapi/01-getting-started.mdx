# Getting Started with FastAPI

<SubHeading>Getting Started with FastAPI, a high-performance, web framework for building APIs with Python</SubHeading>

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance, web framework for building APIs with Python. 
It's designed to be easy to use, efficient, and to provide automatic generation of interactive documentation. 
FastAPI is built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, and it leverages Python 3.6+ type hints for request and response validation.

In this introduction, I'll provide you with code samples to help you get started with FastAPI.

## ✅ **Installation**

You can install FastAPI using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi
```

You'll also want to install a web server like `uvicorn` to serve your FastAPI application:

```bash
pip install uvicorn
```

## ✅ **Creating a FastAPI App**

Here's a basic example of a FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, World"}
```

Save this code to a Python file (e.g., `main.py`).

## ✅ **Running the FastAPI App**

You can run your FastAPI app using `uvicorn`:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This command tells `uvicorn` to run the `app` instance in the `main.py` file and enables auto-reloading for development.

## ✅ **Routes and Path Parameters**

FastAPI makes it easy to define routes and path parameters. Here's an example that includes path parameters:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, query_param: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "query_param": query_param}
```

In this example, we define a route `/items/{item_id}` that takes an `item_id` as a path parameter and an optional `query_param` as a query parameter.

## ✅ **Request and Response Models**

FastAPI allows you to define request and response models using Pydantic models. Here's an example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str = None
    price: float
    tax: float = None

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    return item
```

In this example, we define a Pydantic model `Item` for the request body of the POST request to `/items/`. 
FastAPI automatically validates and parses the incoming JSON data based on this model.

## ✅ **Automatic Documentation**

One of FastAPI's standout features is its automatic generation of interactive API documentation. 
To access the documentation, go to `http://localhost:8000/docs` in your web browser while your FastAPI app is running.

## ✅ **Validation and Serialization**

FastAPI automatically validates incoming requests and serializes responses based on the Pydantic models you define. If data doesn't match the expected model, FastAPI will return validation errors.

## ✅ In Summary

These are just some of the basics of FastAPI. It provides many more features for building robust and efficient APIs, including dependency injection, authentication, and more. 

FastAPI's official documentation is excellent and provides in-depth information on all of its features - [FastAPI Official Documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
