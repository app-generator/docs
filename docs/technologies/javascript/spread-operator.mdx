	How to Use the Spread Operator (…) in JavaScript
</SubHeading>

The spread operator is a powerful JavaScript feature introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and denoted by three dots (`...`). It expands the values of an iterable (such as an array, string, or object) to enable you to access and manipulate the iterable.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced JavaScript developer, learning how to use the spread operator is an essential skill that will take your coding to the next level.
In this article, we'll explore the ins and outs of the spread operator and show you how to use it to write cleaner, more efficient code. So, let's get started!

## Using the spread operator in JavaScript arrays

The spread operator is commonly used in JavaScript to expand the elements of an array. In this section, you'll learn how to concatenate and copy arrays using the spread operator.

```js
const arrValue = ["Hello", "JavaScript"];

console.log(arrValue); //👉 Output: [ 'Hello', 'JavaScript' ]
console.log(...arrValue); //👉 Output: Hello JavaScript
```

### Concatenation

Concatenation is the process of joining two or more arrays to create a new large array. In JavaScript, you can concatenate arrays using the spread operator (`...`).

To concatenate two arrays using the spread operator, simply spread the arrays inside a new array, like this:

```js
const vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
const random = ["b", "d", "f"];

const merged = [...vowels, ...random];
console.log(merged); //👉🏻 Output: ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'b', 'd', 'f']
```

From the code snippet above, there are two arrays - `vowels` and `random`. They are merged into one, called `merged` - containing all the elements of the arrays.

### Copying an array

The spread operator provides a convenient way to copy an array into another array. It is useful when you want to manipulate an array without affecting the original array.

To copy an array using the spread operator, spread the original array inside square brackets `[]`; like this:

```js
const vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
const backup = [...vowels];

console.log(backup); //👉🏻 Output: [ 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' ]
```

From the code snippet above, the `backup` array copies all the elements in the `vowels` array.

> 💡 Any further changes to the `vowels` array will not reflect in the `backup` array, unlike the regular assignment operator.

```js
const vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
const backup = [...vowels];
const newArray = vowels;
vowels.pop(); //👉🏻 removes the last element from the array

console.log(vowels); //👉🏻 [ 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' ]
console.log(backup); //👉🏻 [ 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' ]
console.log(newArray); //👉🏻 [ 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' ]
```

The `newArray` variable creates a reference to the `vowels` variable instead of copying the entire array value.

## Using the spread operator in JavaScript functions

The spread operator can be used to accept an array of parameters in JavaScript functions; in this case, it is called the Rest Operator. It captures any number of arguments passed to the function and groups them into an array.

> 💡 When you place the spread operator before the parameter name of a function declaration, it is called the Rest Operator.

```js
function sumNumbers(...args) {
	let sum = 0;
	for (const num of args) {
		sum += num;
	}
	console.log(sum);
}

sumNumbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9); //👉🏻 Output: 45
```

In the example above, the function `sumNumbers` accepts an array of numbers with an undefined length using the rest operator, then loops through the arguments to add each number together and log the result to the console.

## Using the spread operator in JavaScript objects

The spread operator isn't just limited to arrays in JavaScript; it can be used with objects to execute tasks such as copying, merging, and updating object properties.

### Copying object properties

With the spread operator, you can copy the properties of an object into a new object. This is useful when creating a copy of an object without modifying the original object.

To copy an object using the spread operator, spread the original object inside a new object. Take a look at this example:

```js
const book = {
	name: "Rich Dad Poor Dad",
	author: "Robert Kiyosaki",
};
const bookInfo = {
	...book,
	pages: 336,
	year: 1997,
};

console.log(bookInfo);
/* 👇🏻 Output: {
  name: 'Rich Dad Poor Dad',
  author: 'Robert Kiyosaki',
  pages: 336,
  year: 1997
} */
```

In the example above, the `bookInfo` object copies the properties of the `book` object by using the spread operator to copy the properties of the original `book` object into the `bookInfo` object. 

### Merging objects properties
You can merge two or more objects into a single object using the spread operator (`...`). The spread operator provides a simple way to combine the properties of multiple objects into a single object without modifying the original objects.

To merge objects using the spread operator, spread each object inside curly braces `{}`. Consider the example below:

```js
const info1 = {
	name: "Rich Dad Poor Dad",
	author: "Robert Kiyosaki",
};
const info2 = {
	pages: 336,
	year: 1997,
};

const bookInfo = { ...info1, ...info2 };
console.log(bookInfo);
/* 👇🏻 Output: {
  name: 'Rich Dad Poor Dad',
  author: 'Robert Kiyosaki',
  pages: 336,
  year: 1997
} */
```

In the example above, the two objects - `info1` and `info2` are merged into one using the spread operator.

### Updating object properties

You can also update the properties of an object with the JavaScript spread operator.

Consider the example below:

```js
const book = {
	name: "Rich Dad Poor Dad",
	author: "Robert Kiyosaki",
	year: 2000,
};

const bookInfo = {
	...book,
	year: 1997,
};
console.log(bookInfo);
/*👉🏻 Output: { name: 'Rich Dad Poor Dad', author: 'Robert Kiyosaki', year: 1997 } */
```

The code snippet above updates the `year` property within the `bookInfo` object. In some cases, if you need the previous `year` property, you can create a nested object within the `bookInfo` object as shown below:

```js
const book = {
	name: "Rich Dad Poor Dad",
	author: "Robert Kiyosaki",
	year: 2000,
};
const bookInfo = {
	...book,
	year: 1997,
	previous: { ...book },
};
console.log(bookInfo);
/* 👇🏻 Output: {
{
  name: 'Rich Dad Poor Dad',
  author: 'Robert Kiyosaki',
  year: 1997,
  previous: { name: 'Rich Dad Poor Dad', author: 'Robert Kiyosaki', year: 2000 }
}
*/
```

## Key Takeaways
