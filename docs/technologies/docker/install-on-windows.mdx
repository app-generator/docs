# Install Docker on Windows

<SubHeading>Learn how to install and use Docker on Windows-based systems.</SubHeading>

**Installing [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on Windows** involves a few steps, but it's relatively straightforward. 

Docker for Windows uses Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2) for its backend.

> Here's a general guide on **how to install Docker on Windows**:

## âœ… **Prerequisites**

- You need a Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019 (or later) machine.
- Ensure that you have Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installed. You can enable it through PowerShell:

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```

## âœ… **Enable WSL 2**

Docker Desktop for Windows uses WSL 2 as the backend. To enable it, open PowerShell as an administrator and run:

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

## âœ… **Download Docker Desktop**

Download the Docker Desktop for Windows installer from the Docker website: [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## âœ… **Install Docker Desktop**

Run the Docker Desktop installer and follow the installation wizard's instructions. It will install the necessary components, including Docker Engine, WSL 2, and Hyper-V.

## âœ… **Configure Docker Desktop**

Once installed, launch Docker Desktop. It will appear in your system tray. You may need to sign in with your Docker ID if you have one.

## âœ… **Configure WSL Integration**

Docker Desktop should automatically set up WSL 2 integration. You can configure it further by going to the "Settings" from the system tray icon and selecting "WSL" from the left sidebar. Make sure you have a WSL 2 Linux distribution installed.

## âœ… **Test Installation**

Open a PowerShell or Command Prompt and run a simple Docker command to verify the installation. For example, you can run:

```powershell
docker --version
```

This should display the Docker version installed.

## âœ… **Run a Docker Container**

Test Docker by running a simple container. For example, you can run a basic Nginx web server container:

```powershell
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

This command starts an Nginx container in the background and maps port 80 from the container to port 80 on your Windows machine.

## âœ… **Access the Container**

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost` to see the default Nginx page. You should be able to access the web server running in your Docker container.

That's it! You've **successfully installed and tested Docker on a Windows machine**. 

You can now start exploring Docker further, build your own images, and run various containers for your development and testing needs.
