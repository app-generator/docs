# Getting Started with Rust

## Setup the environment

To get started with Rust, you need to download and install it first. You can find installation instructions on the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Once you have Rust installed, you can create a new Rust project using Cargo, the official Rust package manager. Here's how you can create a new project:

```bash
$ cargo new app_name
$ cd app_name
```

This command creates a new Rust app and sets up the project directory structure.

## Project structure

When starting a new Rust project, it's important to have a clear and organized project structure in order to make the project more maintainable and scalable. Here is an example of a project structure for a new Rust project:

```
.
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs
```

Let's break down what each file and directory is for:

### Files: `Cargo.lock` and `Cargo.toml`

These files are generated by the Cargo package manager, which is the official package manager for Rust. `Cargo.toml` is where you define your project's dependencies and configuration options, while `Cargo.lock` is an automatically generated file that tracks the exact versions of your dependencies.

### Directory: `src/`

This directory is where you put your project's source code. You can find the `main.rs` file in this directory, which is where you define the executable code for your project.

### Directory: `target/`

This directory is where Cargo stores compiled binaries and libraries. The `debug` directory contains the debug build of your project, while the `release` directory contains the optimized release build of your project.

Overall, this project structure provides a clear separation between your project's source code and the build artifacts, making it easy to maintain and scale your project as it grows.

## Running the project

To run the project, you can use the `cargo run` command:

```bash
$ cargo run
```

If you want to build the project without running it, you can use the `cargo build` command:

```bash
$ cargo build
```

If you want to check for errors before running the app, you can use the `cargo check` command:

```bash
$ cargo check
```

Finally, if you want to make a production-ready executable, you can use the `cargo build --release` command:

```bash
$ cargo build --release
```
