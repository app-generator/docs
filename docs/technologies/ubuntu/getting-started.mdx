## `Ubuntu` a short story

Ubuntu is a popular Linux-based operating system that was first released in 2004. It was developed by Canonical Ltd. and is based on the Debian Linux distribution, with the aim of providing an easy-to-use and user-friendly alternative to proprietary operating systems such as Microsoft Windows

Ubuntu uses a package management system called `apt` (Advanced Package Tool) that allows users to easily install, remove, and update software packages on their system.. Today, Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux distributions in the world, used by millions of people across a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to servers and even smartphones.

## Managing the system using the CLI

The command-line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for managing Ubuntu. It allows you to perform various tasks quickly and efficiently Here are some basic commands you need to know:

### `sudo`

The `sudo` command allows you to execute a command with administrative privileges. `sudo` stands for "superuser do".  To use `sudo`, simply type `sudo` followed by the command you want to execute. For example, let's say you want to edit a file system, you need to use `sudo` to run it.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/config
```

When you run this command, Ubuntu will prompt you to enter your password. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to administrative functions.

### `apt`

`apt` is the package manager for Ubuntu. It allows you to install, update, and remove packages from your system. Here are some basic `apt` commands:

- `update`: updates the package list on your system.
- `upgrade`: upgrades all the installed packages on your system.
- `install <packages>`: installs a package.
- `remove <package>`: removes a package.
- `purge <package>`: removes a package and its configuration files.
- `autoremove`: removes any unused packages from your system
- `autoclean`: removes any downloaded package files that are no longer needed.

### `apt-get`

You might notice some people use `apt-get` instead of `apt`. Both command are used for managing software packages on Ubuntu systems. `apt` is actually a newer and more user-friendly version of `apt-get`. However, both commands are still available and you can use whichever one you prefer.

## Managing the users via CLI

With the command-line tools available in Ubuntu, you can easily add and remove users, modify user settings, and perform other tasks related to user management.

Here are some basic commands for managing users via the CLI in Ubuntu:

### Adding a new user

To add a new user to your Ubuntu system, use the following command:

```bash
sudo adduser <username>
```

Replace `<username>` with the desired username. You will then be prompted to set a password and enter some basic information about the user.

### Removing a user

To remove a user from your Ubuntu system, use the following command:

```bash
sudo deluser <username>
```

Replace `<username>` with the username of the user you want to remove. After running this command, the user's home directory and any files or directories associated with their account will be removed from your system.

### Changing user passwords

To change the password for an existing user account, use the following command:

```bash
sudo passwd <username>
```

Replace `<username>` with the username of the user. After running this command, you will be prompted to enter a new password for the user.

## Installing the recommended packages for programming

In Ubuntu, you can install packages easily using the package manager through CLI. To install a package on your Ubuntu system, use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install <package-name>
```

Replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to install.

Here are some recommended package to be installed:

### How to Install Python3

Python is a simple and versatile open-source programming language used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. It has an easy-to-learn syntax and a large library of pre-built modules, making it an excellent choice for beginners and professionals. You can install Python by running this command. 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

Then, verify the installation with the following command.

```bash
python3 --version
pip --version
```

### How to install MySQL

MySQL is a popular relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store, manage and retrieve data. It is an open-source software that is widely used in web applications, and can be accessed through a variety of programming languages. To install and configure MySQL, follow these steps:

1. Install the MySQL server package.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install mysql-server
   ```

2. Start the service

   Once the installation is complete, MySQL will be automatically running. Otherwise, use the following command to start the service.

     CREATE DATABASE appseed_db;
     ```

     Replace `appseed_db` with the name that you want.

   - Create user and grant permission to the user.

     MySQL creates `root` user by default, but it's better to use another user for non-administrative functions. For this demo, we'll grant all permissions to all tables for the created user.

     ```mysql
     CREATE USER 'appseed_db_usr'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass';
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON appseed_db.* TO 'appseed_db_usr'@'localhost';
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
     ```

     Replace `appseed_db` with your database name, `appseed_db_usr` and `pass` with your desired username and password.

   - Exit MySQL

     ```mysql
     exit
     ```

### How to install PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) that offers robustness, scalability, and a wide range of advanced features. Its reliability and ability to handle large amounts of data make it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications. To install and configure PostgreSQL, follow these steps:

1. Install the PostgreSQL server package.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install postgresql
   ```

2. Start the service

   Once the installation is complete, PostgreSQL will be automatically running. Otherwise, use the following command to start the service.

   ```basH
   sudo systemctl start postgresql
   ```

   PortgreSQL will be running on port 5432. This is PortgreSQL's default port number.

3. Configure the database and user

   - Login to PostgreSQL

     ```bash
     sudo -u postgres psql
     ```

   - Create database

     ```postgresql
     CREATE DATABASE appseed_db;
     ```

     Replace `appseed_db` with the name that you want.

   - Create a user and grant permission to the user.

     For this demo, we'll grant all permissions to all tables for the created user.

     ```postgresql
     CREATE USER appseed_db_usr WITH PASSWORD 'pass';
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE appseed_db TO appseed_db_usr;
     ```

     Replace `appseed_db` with your database name, `appseed_db_usr` and `pass` with your desired username and password.

   - Exit PostgreSQL

     ```postgresql
     \q
     ```

### How to Install MongoDB

   redis-cli
   ```

   This will connect to the local Redis instance.

## Managing the services

Services are background processes that perform various tasks, They are used to manage various system functions and can be controlled using the `systemctl` command.

- `start <service-name>`: to start a service
- `stop <service-name>`: to stop a service
- `restart <service-name>`: to restart a service
- `enable <service-name>`: to enable a service to start automatically at boot
- `disable <service-name>`: to disable a service from start automatically at boot
- `status <service-name>`: to check status of a service

For example, if you want to stop MySQL, you can run this command:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop mysql
```

## CRON

CRON is a time-based job scheduling system used in Unix-like operating systems. It allows users to schedule repetitive tasks, such as running scripts or performing backups, at specific times or intervals. 

### Creating CRON job

To create a new CRON job, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and type the following command.

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

   This command will open the CRON configuration file. If this is your first time using CRON, you'll be prompted to choose your default text editor. Choose your preferred editor and press Enter.

2. Once the editor opens, add a new line at the bottom of the file with the following syntax:

   ```
   * * * * * command-to-be-executed
   ```

   This line represents your CRON job. The first five asterisks is a crontab that represents the time and date parameters for the job.

   - Minute (0-59)
   - Hour (0-23)
   - Day of the month (1-31)
   - Month (1-12)
   - Day of the week (0-6, where Sunday is 0)

   You can use tools like [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to help you creating a crontab. For example, to schedule a job to run at 0:00 AM every day, use the following crontab.

   ```bash
   0 0 * * * command-to-be-executed
   ```

3. Once you've added your CRON job, save and exit the editor.

### Viewing CRON jobs

To view your current CRON jobs, Open your terminal and type the following command:

```bash
crontab -l
```

This will display a list of all your current CRON jobs in the terminal window.

### Removing CRON jobs

To remove a CRON job, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and type the following command to open the CRON configuration file:

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Once the editor opens, locate the line that corresponds to the job you want to remove and delete it.
3. Save and exit the editor.
