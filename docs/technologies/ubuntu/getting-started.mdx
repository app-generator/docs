## `Ubuntu` a short story

Ubuntu is a popular Linux-based operating system that was first released in 2004. 
It was developed by Canonical Ltd. and is based on the Debian Linux distribution, with the aim of providing an easy-to-use and user-friendly alternative to proprietary operating systems such as Microsoft Windows.

Ubuntu uses a package management system called `apt` (Advanced Package Tool) that allows users to easily install, remove, and update software packages on their system. 
Today, Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux distributions in the world, used by millions of people across a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to servers and even smartphones.

<br />

## `Ubuntu` How to install

There are two main ways to install Ubuntu: on a laptop/desktop and in a virtual machine.

### Installing Ubuntu on a Laptop/Desktop

Before we begin, here's what you'll need:

- A laptop or PC with at least 25GB of storage space.
- A 4GB or larger USB stick/flash drive.
- An Ubuntu ISO file. You can download it from the [official Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/download).

#### Create a bootable USB stick

To install Ubuntu on your computer, you need to create a bootable USB drive with the Ubuntu ISO file. Here's how you can do it on Windows:

1. Download the Ubuntu ISO file from the [official website](https://ubuntu.com/download).
2. Download and install [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/). It's a free and open source USB stick writing tool that you can use to create a bootable USB drive.
3. Insert a USB drive with at least 4GB of space into your computer.
4. Open Rufus and select the USB drive you inserted.
5. Select the Ubuntu ISO file you downloaded.
6. Keep the rest as default and click "START".
7. Rufus may ask for additional files to complete writing the ISO. If this happens, select **Yes** to continue.
8. You'll be alerted that Rufus has detected that the Ubuntu ISO is an *ISOHybrid image*. Keep *Write in ISO Image mode* selected and click **OK** to continue.
9. Rufus will warn you that all data on your selected USB device will be destroyed. Double check that you've selected the correct device and click **OK** when you're sure.
10. Wait a few minutes for Rufus to write the ISO to your USB stick.

If you are using a different operating system, you can use an alternative tool like [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) to create the bootable USB drive.

#### Install Ubuntu

1. Restart your computer and enter the BIOS by pressing F2 or F10 or F12 (depending on your computer) when the logo appears.
2. Go to the "Boot" tab and select the bootable USB drive as the primary boot option. Save and exit the BIOS. Your computer will restart and boot into the Ubuntu installation process.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Ubuntu on your computer.
4. In the "Type of Installation" page, select "Erase disk and install Ubuntu" if you want Ubuntu to be the only operating system on your hard drive.
5. Review your configuration then click "Install" when you are sure. Note that once you begin the installation process, you cannot return to this point.
6. Once the process finishes, you will be asked to restart the system. Remove the USB disk and press enter. Your system will reboot and start Ubuntu.

You've successfully installed Ubuntu on your laptop or desktop computer. Enjoy exploring this powerful and user-friendly operating system!

### Installing Ubuntu in a Virtual Machine via VirtualBox

If you don't want to install Ubuntu directly on your computer, you can also install it in a virtual machine using VirtualBox. Here's how to do it:

1. Download and install VirtualBox from the [official website](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2. Download the Ubuntu ISO file from the [official Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/download).
3. Open VirtualBox and click "New" to create a new virtual machine.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a new virtual machine. Fill in the appropriate details.
5. Fill the basic details of your virtual machine.
   - Name: Ubuntu 22.04 (depends on your version)
   - Folder: Select folder where your virtual machines will be stored
   - ISO Image: Ubuntu ISO file you downloaded
   - Type: Linux
   - Version: Ubuntu (64-bit)
6. Create a user profile with a username and password for the automatic installation.
7. Specify the resources for your virtual machine, such as RAM and CPU usage, and the size of the hard disk.
   - Base memory: At least 4GB
   - Processors: 4 CPUs
   - Hard disk: Create a new virtual hard disk
   - Disk size: At least 25 GB
8. Review the summary of your machine settings and click "Finish" to create the virtual machine.
9. Start the virtual machine and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the Ubuntu installation.

## Managing Ubuntu using the CLI

The command-line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for managing Ubuntu. 
It allows you to perform various tasks quickly and efficiently Here are some basic commands you need to know:

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ `sudo`

The `sudo` command allows you to execute a command with administrative privileges. `sudo` stands for "superuser do".  
To use `sudo`, simply type `sudo` followed by the command you want to execute. For example, let's say you want to edit a file system, you need to use `sudo` to run it.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/config
```

When you run this command, Ubuntu will prompt you to enter your password. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to administrative functions.

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ `apt`

`apt` is the package manager for Ubuntu. It allows you to install, update, and remove packages from your system. Here are some basic `apt` commands:

- `update`: updates the package list on your system.
- `upgrade`: upgrades all the installed packages on your system.
- `install <packages>`: installs a package.
- `remove <package>`: removes a package.
- `purge <package>`: removes a package and its configuration files.
- `autoremove`: removes any unused packages from your system
- `autoclean`: removes any downloaded package files that are no longer needed.

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ `apt-get`

You might notice some people use `apt-get` instead of `apt`. 
Both command are used for managing software packages on Ubuntu systems. `apt` is actually a newer and more user-friendly version of `apt-get`. 
However, both commands are still available and you can use whichever one you prefer.

<br />

## Managing the users via CLI

With the command-line tools available in Ubuntu, you can easily add and remove users, modify user settings, and perform other tasks related to user management.

Here are some basic commands for managing users via the CLI in Ubuntu:

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ `Adding` a new user

To add a new user to your Ubuntu system, use the following command:

```bash
sudo adduser <username>
```

Replace `<username>` with the desired username. You will then be prompted to set a password and enter some basic information about the user.

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ `Removing` a user

To remove a user from your Ubuntu system, use the following command:

```bash
sudo deluser <username>
```

Replace `<username>` with the username of the user you want to remove. After running this command, the user's home directory and any files or directories associated with their account will be removed from your system.

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ `Changing` user passwords

To change the password for an existing user account, use the following command:

```bash
sudo passwd <username>
```

Replace `<username>` with the username of the user. After running this command, you will be prompted to enter a new password for the user.
