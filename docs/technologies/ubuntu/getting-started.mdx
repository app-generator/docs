## `Ubuntu` a short story

Ubuntu is a popular Linux-based operating system that was first released in 2004. 
It was developed by Canonical Ltd. and is based on the Debian Linux distribution, with the aim of providing an easy-to-use and user-friendly alternative to proprietary operating systems such as Microsoft Windows.

Ubuntu uses a package management system called `apt` (Advanced Package Tool) that allows users to easily install, remove, and update software packages on their system. 
Today, Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux distributions in the world, used by millions of people across a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to servers and even smartphones.

## Managing Ubuntu using the CLI

The command-line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for managing Ubuntu. 
It allows you to perform various tasks quickly and efficiently Here are some basic commands you need to know:

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ `sudo`

The `sudo` command allows you to execute a command with administrative privileges. `sudo` stands for "superuser do".  
To use `sudo`, simply type `sudo` followed by the command you want to execute. For example, let's say you want to edit a file system, you need to use `sudo` to run it.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/config
```

When you run this command, Ubuntu will prompt you to enter your password. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to administrative functions.

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ `apt`

`apt` is the package manager for Ubuntu. It allows you to install, update, and remove packages from your system. Here are some basic `apt` commands:

- `update`: updates the package list on your system.
- `upgrade`: upgrades all the installed packages on your system.
- `install <packages>`: installs a package.
- `remove <package>`: removes a package.
- `purge <package>`: removes a package and its configuration files.
- `autoremove`: removes any unused packages from your system
- `autoclean`: removes any downloaded package files that are no longer needed.

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ `apt-get`

You might notice some people use `apt-get` instead of `apt`. 
Both command are used for managing software packages on Ubuntu systems. `apt` is actually a newer and more user-friendly version of `apt-get`. 
However, both commands are still available and you can use whichever one you prefer.

<br />

## Managing the users via CLI

With the command-line tools available in Ubuntu, you can easily add and remove users, modify user settings, and perform other tasks related to user management.

```

Replace `<username>` with the desired username. You will then be prompted to set a password and enter some basic information about the user.

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ `Removing` a user

To remove a user from your Ubuntu system, use the following command:

```bash
sudo deluser <username>
```

Replace `<username>` with the username of the user you want to remove. After running this command, the user's home directory and any files or directories associated with their account will be removed from your system.

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ `Changing` user passwords

To change the password for an existing user account, use the following command:

```bash
crontab -e
```

This command will open the CRON configuration file. If this is your first time using CRON, you'll be prompted to choose your default text editor. Choose your preferred editor and press Enter.

> Once the editor opens, add a new line at the bottom of the file with the following syntax:

```
* * * * * command-to-be-executed
```

This line represents your CRON job. The first five asterisks is a crontab that represents the time and date parameters for the job.

- Minute (0-59)
- Hour (0-23)
- Day of the month (1-31)
- Month (1-12)
- Day of the week (0-6, where Sunday is 0)

You can use tools like [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to help you creating a crontab. For example, to schedule a job to run at 0:00 AM every day, use the following crontab.

```bash
0 0 * * * command-to-be-executed
```

> Once you've added your CRON job, save and exit the editor.

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ `Viewing` CRON jobs

To view your current CRON jobs, Open your terminal and type the following command:

```bash
crontab -l
```

This will display a list of all your current CRON jobs in the terminal window.

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ Removing CRON jobs

To remove a CRON job, follow these steps:

- Open your terminal and type the following command to open the CRON configuration file:
