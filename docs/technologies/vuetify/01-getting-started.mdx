# Getting Started with Vuetify

<SubHeading>Getting Started with Vuetify - KickOff for Beginners</SubHeading>

**Getting started with [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/)** is relatively straightforward, and it involves setting up a Vue.js project with Vuetify as your UI framework. 

![What IS Vuetify - Tutorial provided by AppSeed.](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/51070104/270630877-a0d15af1-c7e1-4246-ab69-9284cee625b2.jpg) 

Here are step-by-step instructions on how to get started:

## âœ… Install Dependencies  

Install Node.js and Vue CLI (if not already installed)**

If you don't have Node.js installed, download and install it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Once Node.js is installed, you can use npm (Node Package Manager) to install Vue CLI globally by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

## âœ… Create The Project

**Create a New Vue.js Project**

Now that you have Vue CLI installed, you can create a new Vue.js project with the Vue CLI's command-line interface. Replace "my-vuetify-app" with your desired project name.

```bash
vue create my-vuetify-app
```

During the project setup, you'll be prompted to pick a preset. You can either choose the default preset or manually select features. 

Ensure you have the Babel, ESLint, and Vue Router features enabled since Vuetify works well with them.

## âœ… Install Vuetify

Navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd my-vuetify-app
```

Install Vuetify using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install vuetify
# or
yarn add vuetify
```

## âœ… Configure Vuetify

After installing Vuetify, you need to configure it. Open the `src/main.js` file and add the following lines to import and use Vuetify:

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import vuetify from './plugins/vuetify' // Import Vuetify from your plugins folder

Vue.config.productionTip = false

new Vue({
  render: h => h(App),
  vuetify // Add Vuetify as a plugin to your Vue instance
}).$mount('#app')
```

## âœ… Create Components 

Now, you can create a simple Vuetify component. Open the `src/App.vue` file and replace its contents with the following example:

```vue
<template>
  <v-app>
    <v-main>
      <v-container>
        <v-btn color="primary">Click me</v-btn>
      </v-container>
    </v-main>
  </v-app>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'App'
}
</script>
```

This example uses Vuetify's `v-btn` component to create a button with a primary color.

## âœ… Run The Application

You're ready to run your Vue.js application with Vuetify. In your project directory, run:

```bash
npm run serve
# or
yarn serve
```

This command will start the development server, and you can access your application at `http://localhost:8080` (or another port if 8080 is in use). You'll see your Vuetify button in action.

## âœ… In Summary  

To create more complex and feature-rich applications with Vuetify, explore the official documentation, which provides detailed information about Vuetify components, layouts, theming, and customization: https://vuetifyjs.com/en/

You can also check out the documentation's "Getting Started" section for additional guidance: https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/quick-start

With these steps, you have successfully set up a basic Vue.js project with Vuetify. You can now start building modern, responsive web applications using Vuetify's extensive component library and Material Design guidelines.
