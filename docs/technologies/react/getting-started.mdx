# Getting Started with React

<SubHeading>Getting Started with React</SubHeading>

- Install `Node.js` and `npm` (if you haven't already). 
  - You can download them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/

- Create a new React project using create-react-app. Open up your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
$ npx create-react-app my-app
```

This will create a new React project called `my-app` in your current directory.

- Navigate to your project directory and start the development server:

```bash
$ cd my-app
$ npm start
```

This will start the development server and open your app in your default browser.

- Start editing your app! The `create-react-app` command sets up a basic React project with some sample code. You can find the main app component in the `src/App.js` file.

- As you learn more about `React`, you can add new components, styles, and functionality to your app.

That's it! You now have a basic React app up and running. Of course, there's a lot more to learn about React, but this should give you a good starting point.
