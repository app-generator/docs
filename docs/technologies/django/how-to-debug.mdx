# How to DEBUG Django

<SubHeading>Learn how to DEBUG Django and activate Logging</SubHeading>

**Logging** and **Debugging** are essential aspects of any web application, as it allows developers to record and analyze the execution of their code, making it easier to identify and resolve issues. 

In a **Django** application, proper logging can not only save valuable time during development and debugging but also help you ensure the stability and security of your application in production.

In this article, we will discuss the importance of logging and debugging in Django applications. Our journey will be divided into three key sections:

- Configuring Django for Logging
- Using `pdb` in a Django Application
- Configuring Django Debug Toolbar

So, let's dive in and explore the world of Django logging!

<br />

## âœ… Project Setup

For this article, you can find the code on GitHub at **[How to DEBUG Django Sample](https://github.com/app-generator/sample-django-debug)**.

To make things quicker, you can clone this specific commit so you can follow the tutorial.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/sample-django-debug.git
$ cd sample-django-debug
```

Once the project is set up, you can install the dependencies and start the Django project.

```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py runserver
```

<br />

## âœ… Configuring Django for Logging

Django natively integrates logging using Python's built-in logging module. This integration allows developers to easily track events, monitor application behavior, and diagnose issues.

Django allows you principally to use the default logging system or to create your custom loggers.

> **Default logging settings** 

Django provides a default logging configuration that is applied if you don't explicitly configure logging in your `settings.py`. 
This default configuration logs messages with the `WARNING` level and above to the console. In `DEBUG` mode, Django also logs SQL queries.
    
> **Custom loggers** 

Django allows you to create custom loggers for your applications by defining the `LOGGING` dictionary in your settings.py file, as explained in the previous answer. 
This gives you full control over the logging behavior of your application, allowing you to configure loggers, handlers, filters, and formatters to meet your specific requirements.
    
We will write our configuration for Logging in the next lines.

<br />

## âœ… Custom Logging Settings

As stated in the previous section, customizing the `Logging` in Django add the following configuration in `core/settings.py`.

```python
# core/settings.py

...

LOGGING = {
    # Define the logging version
    "version": 1,
    # Enable the existing loggers
    "disable_existing_loggers": False,
    "formatters": {
        "default": {
            "format": "%(asctime)s %(name)-12s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s",
        },
        "django.server": DEFAULT_LOGGING["formatters"]["django.server"],
    },
    # Define the handlers
    "handlers": {
        "apps_home": {
            "level": "DEBUG",
            "class": "logging.FileHandler",
            "filename": "logs/apps_home.log",
        },
        "console": {
            "level": "DEBUG",
            "class": "logging.StreamHandler",
            "formatter": "default",
        },
    },
    "loggers": {
        "apps.home": {
            "handlers": ["apps_home", "console"],
            "level": "DEBUG",
            "propagate": False,
        },
    },
}
```

Let's explain the code we have above :

> ðŸ‘‰ `General configuration`

* **version**: `1`
    
    * The version key is set to 1, indicating that this is a version 1 schema for logging configuration, which is the default and only version available for the logging configuration in Python's logging module.
        
* **disable_existing_loggers**: `False`
    
    * This setting controls whether or not to disable all existing loggers when the configuration is applied. By setting it to `False`, the existing loggers are enabled.
        

> ðŸ‘‰ **Formatters**
    

* **default**
    
    * A custom formatter with the format string `"%(asctime)s %(name)-12s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s"`. This format includes a timestamp, logger name, log level, and the log message.
        
* **django.server**
    
    * This formatter is the same as the default formatter for the `django.server` logger.
        

> ðŸ‘‰ **Handlers**
    

* **apps_home**
    
    * A file handler that logs messages with a log level of `DEBUG` and above to a file named `logs/apps_home.log`.
        
* **console**
    
    * A stream handler logs messages with a log level of `DEBUG` and above to the console (standard output). This handler uses the `default` formatter defined earlier.
        

> ðŸ‘‰ **Loggers**
    

* **apps.home**
    
    * A logger for the `apps.home` module (replace this with the actual name of your application or module). This logger has two handlers, `apps_home` and `console`, which means it will log messages to both the specified log file and the console. The log level is set to `DEBUG`, so it will log messages with a level of `DEBUG` and above. The `propagate` key is set to `False`, which means that the log messages handled by this logger will not be passed to higher-level loggers (e.g., the root logger or the `django` logger).
        

This `LOGGING` configuration provides a custom logging setup for the `apps.home` module in a Django application we can use and test.

First of all, create a new folder called `logs` at the root of the project. This directory will contain the log files of this project. Then, add a file to this newly created directory.

```bash
cd logs && touch apps_home.log
```

After that, add a file called `loggers.py` at the root of the project. This file will contain the declaration of the custom loggers.

```python
import logging

# Home application logging

apps_home_logger = logging.getLogger("apps.home")
```

The resulting logger instance, `apps_home_logger` can be used throughout the `apps.home` application to log messages. This logger is already configured in the Django settings (like in the `LOGGING` dictionary you provided earlier), so it will use the handlers, formatters, and log levels you specified in the configuration. To log messages with this logger, you can use its methods, such as `apps_home_logger.debug()`, `apps_home_logger.info()`, `apps_home_logger.warning()`, `apps_home_logger.error()`, and `apps_home_logger.critical()`.

Great! Let's now write a view that should return a **500 error page**. In the `core/views.py` file, add the following function.

```python
from logging import CRITICAL

from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.shortcuts import render

from loggers import apps_home_logger

...

def test_logs(request):
    users = User.objects.all()

    try:
        a = 1 / 0
        return render(request, "pages/index.html")
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        apps_home_logger.log(CRITICAL, msg=str(e))

        return render(request, "pages/examples/500.html")
```

This code is part of a Django view module that demonstrates how to use the custom `apps_home_logger` for logging critical errors. The view function `test_logs` deliberately raises a `ZeroDivisionError` and logs the error message using the custom logger.

Visit the project at this link : `http://localhost:8000/test_logs` and you will see the current result

And you can check the `logs/apps_home.log` and you will see the content.

```plaintext
division by zero
```

And we have just logged our first error. Using the logging feature integrated with Django, we have built a custom logger we can use across the whole Django application to log errors. ðŸš€

In the next section, we will explore how to use `pdb` for debugging in a Django application.

<br />

## âœ…  Using **PDB** for Debugging

`pdb`, short for "Python Debugger", is a built-in Python module that provides a way to interactively debug your code. 

You can use `pdb` in a Django application to debug your views, models, or other code within the app. We will use `pdb` in the `test_logs` view by adding `pdb.set_trace()` after the line `users = User.objects.all()`.

```python
...
def test_logs(request):
    users = User.objects.all()

    pdb.set_trace()
...
```

The line `pdb.set_trace()` is used to create a breakpoint in your Python code when using the `pdb` debugger. 
When the code execution reaches this line, it will pause and open an interactive debugging session in your terminal or console.

At this point, you can interact with the debugger using various commands to inspect the variables, step through the code, execute arbitrary code, and more. 
This helps you identify and fix issues in your code more efficiently by providing an interactive debugging environment.

Here are some useful `pdb` commands you can use during the debugging session:

* `n` (next): Execute the next line in the current function.
    
* `s` (step): Execute the current line and stop at the next line, stepping into function calls.
    
* `c` (continue): Continue the execution until the next breakpoint or the end of the program.
    
* `q` (quit): Quit the debugger and exit the program.
    
* `p` (print): Print the value of an expression or variable. For example, `p variable_name`.
    
* `pp` (pretty-print): Pretty-print the value of an expression or variable.
    
* `l` (list): List the source code around the current line.
    
* `h` (help): Show a list of available commands.
    

Visit this URL again [http://localhost:8000/test\_logs](http://localhost:8000/test_logs) and go on the terminal when you are running the Django server and let's type some commands. 

You can check the results of these commands typed in the image below.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682867617748/b896ea35-e0e3-4300-987e-b123af4ba1fa.png)

To quit the interactive debugging terminal, just type `q` and Django will continue the execution of the code.

Pdb is a great tool you can use in development to leverage your debugging requirements in a Django application. 
However, it's not recommended to use `pdb.set_trace()` in a live, production environment, as it may cause the application to hang when it reaches the breakpoint. Use `pdb` only during development and testing.

> If you're using Python 3.7 or later, you can use the built-in `breakpoint()` function instead of `pdb.set_trace()`. To do this, simply replace the `pdb.set_trace()` line with:
> 
> ```python
> breakpoint()
> ```
> 
> By default, this will invoke `pdb`, but it can be customized to use other debuggers if needed.

We now understand how to use `pdb` to debug in our Django application. 
However, you might also want to have real-time data and a better description of errors when building a web application or an API with Django. 
In the next section, we will learn why and how to use `django-debug-toolbar`.

<br />

## âœ… Integrating `django-debug-toolbar`

As a developer, you might have already faced issues such as performance issues, SQL queries, template rendering issues, and more, all within the context of your application.

[**Django Debug Toolbar**](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a third-party package that provides a set of panels 
displaying various debug information about the current request/response in your Django application. 

It is an essential tool for Django developers and it can help you with the following issues:

> **Performance analysis** 

It allows you to analyze the performance of your views, identifying potential bottlenecks and slow database queries.
    
> **SQL query inspection** 

It provides detailed information about the SQL queries executed during a request, including their execution times and the ability to see the full query with parameters.
    
> **Template debugging** 

It displays the context and inheritance of your templates, making it easier to debug template-related issues.
    
> **Cache usage** 

It shows cache usage statistics, helping you optimize your application's caching strategy.
    
> **Signals** 

It displays a list of signals triggered during the request, which can be useful for debugging signal-related issues.
    
> **Request/response data** 

It provides information about the request and response, such as HTTP headers, cookies, and more.

Let's install the package and configure it in our Django application. First of all, install the package using `pip`.

```bash
pip install django-debug-toolbar
```

Next, Add the package Django application to your `INSTALLED_APPS`. In your Django project's settings.py file, add `'debug_toolbar'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:

```python
...
# Application definition

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "admin_volt.apps.AdminVoltConfig",
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    "debug_toolbar", # <- Django debug toolbar
    "home",
]
...
```

The next step is to add the middleware. In the `settings.py` file, add `'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware'` to the `MIDDLEWARE` list. 
Ensure it is placed after `'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware'`.

```python
...
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # ...
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',
    # ...
]
...
```

We can then configure the internal IPs and add some configuration for the js files. The toolbar will only be shown for clients connecting from specific IP addresses. 
In your settings.py file, set the `INTERNAL_IPS` setting to include your IP address or use `'127.0.0.1'` and `localhost` for local development:

```python
INTERNAL_IPS = [
    "127.0.0.1",
    "localhost",
]

mimetypes.add_type("application/javascript", ".js", True)

DEBUG_TOOLBAR_PATCH_SETTINGS = False
```

And finally, we need to add the URL of the Django debug toolbar application to the `core/urls.py` file.

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path("", include("home.urls")),
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("", include("admin_volt.urls")),
    path("debug/", include("debug_toolbar.urls")),
]
```

The configuration is done and you can visit `http://localhost:8000` and you will notice a bar at the right of your page.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682869351513/13ec3ba8-e0a9-461f-8476-e25954aac185.png)

As you can see, you have many options on the panel that you can explore

> **Timer** 

Displays the time taken to process the request, render the template, and execute SQL queries.
    
> **SQL** 

Shows the number of SQL queries executed during the request, along with the total time taken. Clicking on this panel reveals a list of executed queries with their execution times, and you can click on each query to see the full SQL statement with parameters. This can help you identify slow or redundant queries and optimize your database interactions.
    
> **Cache** 

Provides cache usage statistics, including the number of cache hits, misses, and sets during the request. This can help you optimize your application's caching strategy.
    
> **Templates** 

Displays information about the templates used in the current request, such as the context and inheritance. This can help you debug template-related issues.
    
> **Static files** 

Shows information about the static files used in the current request, including the number of files and their total size. This can help you optimize your application's static file usage.
    
> **Signals** 

Lists the signals triggered during the request, which can be useful for debugging signal-related issues.
    
> **Request** 

Displays information about the current request, such as the HTTP headers, cookies, and query parameters.
    
> **Response** 

Provides information about the response, such as the status code, content type, and content length.

And we are done.ðŸš€ We have just integrated `django-debug-toolbar` in the Django application and you can have stats that can help you optimize the application.

Coupled with `pdb` and `logging`, you have a set of powerful tools you can use for debugging in your Django application.

<br />

## âœ… Conclusion

In this article, we have talked about `Django Debug Toolbar`, `pdb`, and `logging` which are essential tools for efficient Django application development. 
Utilizing these tools, you can identify performance bottlenecks, debug code issues, and optimize database queries with ease.
