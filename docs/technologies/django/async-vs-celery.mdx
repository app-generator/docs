# Django Async vs. Celery

<SubHeading>Learn the key differences between Django Async and Celery</SubHeading>

This page explains the key differences between [Django Async](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/async/) and [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/), 
two asynchronous technologies used in Python-based projects. 

**Celery and Django Async** are both technologies used for handling asynchronous tasks in Python web applications, but they serve different purposes and have some key differences. 

> Here are **the key differences** between them and also some code samples for each.

## ✅ **Celery**

**Celery** is a distributed task queue system that allows you to offload time-consuming or background tasks to be executed asynchronously. 
It's not tied to any specific web framework and can be used with various frameworks or standalone applications.

### **Key Features of Celery**

- Distributed and scalable.
- Supports various message brokers like RabbitMQ, Redis, and others.
- Task prioritization and scheduling.
- Supports periodic (cron-like) tasks.

Here's a basic example of how to use Celery:

```python
# Install Celery and a message broker (e.g., Redis or RabbitMQ) first

from celery import Celery

# Create a Celery instance
app = Celery('myapp', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

# Define a Celery task
@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# Call the task asynchronously
result = add.delay(4, 5)

# Get the result later
print(result.get())
```

## ✅ **Django Async**

**Django Async** is a feature introduced in Django 3.1+ that allows you to write asynchronous code within your Django web application. 
It's primarily used for improving the performance of I/O-bound operations within Django views, but it's not a full-fledged task queue like Celery.

### **Key Features of Django Async**

- Works within the Django framework.
- Supports asynchronous views, middleware, and database queries.
- Utilizes Python's `async` and `await` syntax.
- Useful for I/O-bound tasks within Django views.

Here's a basic example of how to use `Django Async` in a view:

```python
# Django 3.1+ is required for async support

from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.db import transaction
from asgiref.sync import async_to_sync

# Import the database model
from myapp.models import MyModel

@transaction.atomic
@async_to_sync
async def async_view(request):
    # Perform an asynchronous database query
    async with MyModel.objects.using('my_db').async_db.transaction():
        instance = await MyModel.objects.using('my_db').async_db.get(pk=1)

    # Return a JSON response
    return JsonResponse({'result': instance.field_value})
```

<br />

## ✅ **Key Differences**

### **Use Case**

- Use `Celery` for handling general-purpose background tasks and offloading heavy computation.
- Use `Django Async` for optimizing I/O-bound operations within Django views or middleware.

### **Integration**
   
- `Celery` is a standalone tool and can be used with any Python application.
- `Django Async` is specific to the Django framework and can be used within Django projects.

### **Complexity**

- `Celery` provides a more comprehensive task queue system with features like scheduling and prioritization.
- `Django Async` is simpler and designed for handling asynchronous operations within Django.

## ✅ In Summary

Choose the tool that best fits your project's requirements. If you need a robust task queue system for various tasks and background processing, **Celery** is a better choice. 
If you want to optimize **Django** views with asynchronous I/O operations, then Django Async is a suitable option.
