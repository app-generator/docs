<SubHeading>Learn how to manage Backups & DB Restore in Django</SubHeading>

> **Data loss prevention**

A database backup can help you recover your data in the event of a hardware failure, software corruption, or human error. 
This can save you a lot of time and money, as you will not have to recreate your data from scratch.

> **Disaster recovery** 

A database backup can help you recover your data in the event of a natural disaster, such as a flood or fire. 
This can help you keep your business running even in the event of a major disruption.

> **Compliance** 

In some industries, some regulations require businesses to keep backups of their data. 
For example, the financial services industry is required to keep backups of their data for seven years.

## ✅ Using `django-dbbackup` library 

`django-dbbackup` is a Django app that can be used to back up your database to a variety of storage locations, including Amazon S3, Dropbox, and the local file system. 
It also supports compression and encryption, so you can be sure that your backups are secure.

`django-dbbackup` provides management commands to help you back up and restore your project database and media files. It is made to:

- Allow you to secure your backup with GPG signature and encryption.
- Archive with compression.
- Deal easily with remote archiving.
- Keep your development database up to date.
- Use Crontab or Celery to setup automated backups

## ✅ Setting up the Django project

For this tutorial, we will be using **[Django DB Backup/Restore](https://github.com/app-generator/sample-django-backup-restore)** sample

> Clone the sample repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/sample-django-backup-restore
$ cd sample-django-backup-restore
```

> Create a virtual environment and activate it

```bash
$ virtualenv venv
$
$ source venv/bin/activate      # On Linux/Mac
$
$ .\venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
```

<br />

## ✅ Configuring `django-dbbackup`

> Install project dependencies

```bash
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Migrate database tables and create a superuser

```bash
(venv) $ python manage.py migrate
(venv) $ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

> Install `django-dbbackup` using pip

```
(venv) $ pip install django-dbbackup
```

At this moment,  that `django-dbbackup` has been installed, we will be configuring the Django project to recognize the application.
Make the following changes to `core/settings.py`

```py
# core/settings.py
...
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'dbbackup',  # django-dbbackup
)
...
DBBACKUP_STORAGE = 'django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage'
DBBACKUP_STORAGE_OPTIONS = {'location': 'backup/'}
...
```

By default, `django-dbbackup` uses the built-in file system storage to manage files in a local directory. 
This creates a `dump` file in your project directory or the specified directory.

`DBBACKUP_STORAGE` is used to specify the storage system to be used and `DBBACKUP_STORAGE_OPTIONS` is a dictionary containing the configuration for the storage system.
`django-dbbackup` is designed to use the right tool to create dump files when working with any database engine, an example is `psql` for Postgresql databases and `mysqldump` for MySQL databases.

<br />

## ✅ Creating backup files

> Execute the command below on your terminal to create backup files for your database

```bash
(venv) $ python manage.py dbbackup
```

This command creates a dump file in the location specified in `DBBACKUP_STORAGE_OPTIONS`.

This command can also be executed to create compressed files by adding an optional flag

```bash
(venv) $ python manage.py dbbackup -z       # create compressed dump files
```

<br />

## ✅ DataBase Restore

Restoring the database from backup files can be done by executing the command below on your terminal

```bash
(venv) $ python manage.py dbrestore
(venv) $
(venv) $ python manage.py dbrestore -z # when restoring from a compressed file
```

After running the command above, your database would be restored to the state of the last backup made using `django-dbbackup`

## ✅ Conclusion
