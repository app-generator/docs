# Integrate Django with PayPal

<SubHeading>Learn how to integrate Django with PayPal for payments</SubHeading>

Integrating PayPal with Django allows you to accept online payments through PayPal's payment gateway. 
PayPal offers different integration methods, but one of the most common and straightforward approaches is to use PayPal's REST API. 

![Integrate Django with PayPal - Tutorial provided by AppSeed.](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/51070104/268709753-d2b4f9a7-2380-4bdb-844e-3144f5c68919.jpg) 

Here's a step-by-step guide on **how to integrate PayPal with Django** using the REST API:

## âœ… **Set Up a PayPal Business Account**

Before you can integrate PayPal with your Django application, you need to have a PayPal Business account. 
If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a PayPal Business account on the [PayPal website](https://www.paypal.com).

## âœ… **Create a PayPal REST App**

Once you have a **PayPal Business** account, you'll need to create a PayPal REST app to obtain your client ID and secret key. `Here's how you can do it`:

- Log in to your PayPal Business account.
- Navigate to the [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications) and log in with your PayPal credentials.
- Click on "My Apps & Credentials" and then click the "Create App" button under the REST API apps section.
- Give your app a name, select the sandbox developer account, and click "Create App."
- You will now see your client ID and secret key on the app details page. Keep these credentials secure as you'll need them in your Django application.

## **Install the `paypalrestsdk` Library**

You'll need to install the `paypalrestsdk` library to interact with PayPal's REST API in your Django application. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install paypalrestsdk
```

## âœ… **Configure Django Settings**

In your Django project's settings, add your PayPal client ID and secret key:

```python
# settings.py

PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = 'your_client_id'
PAYPAL_SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
```

## âœ… **Create a Payment View**

Create a Django view that handles the payment process using the PayPal REST API. Below is an example view:

```python
# views.py

import paypalrestsdk
from django.conf import settings
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect

paypalrestsdk.configure({
    "mode": "sandbox",  # Use "live" for production
    "client_id": settings.PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID,
    "client_secret": settings.PAYPAL_SECRET_KEY
})

def create_payment(request):
    payment = paypalrestsdk.Payment({
        "intent": "sale",
        "payer": {
            "payment_method": "paypal"
        },
        "redirect_urls": {
            "return_url": "http://localhost:8000/payment/execute/",
            "cancel_url": "http://localhost:8000/payment/cancel/"
        },
        "transactions": [{
            "item_list": {
                "items": [{
                    "name": "Item Name",
                    "sku": "item001",
                    "price": "10.00",
                    "currency": "USD",
                    "quantity": 1
                }]
            },
            "amount": {
                "total": "10.00",
                "currency": "USD"
            },
            "description": "Payment for Item Name"
        }]
    })

    if payment.create():
        for link in payment.links:
            if link.rel == "approval_url":
                # Redirect the user to PayPal for payment approval
                return redirect(link.href)
    else:
        print(payment.error)

    return render(request, 'payment/create_payment.html')
```

## âœ… **Create Payment Execution View**

Create a view that handles the execution of the PayPal payment after the user approves it:

```python
# views.py

def execute_payment(request):
    payment_id = request.GET.get('paymentId')
    payer_id = request.GET.get('PayerID')

    payment = paypalrestsdk.Payment.find(payment_id)

    if payment.execute({"payer_id": payer_id}):
        # Payment successful
        return render(request, 'payment/success.html')
    else:
        print(payment.error)
        # Handle payment failure
        return render(request, 'payment/failure.html')
```

## âœ… **Configure URL Patterns**

Set up URL patterns in your Django project's `urls.py` to map to the views created above:

```python
# urls.py

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('payment/create/', views.create_payment, name='create_payment'),
    path('payment/execute/', views.execute_payment, name='execute_payment'),
    # Add other URL patterns as needed
]
```

## âœ… **Create Templates**

Create HTML templates for your payment views (`create_payment.html`, `success.html`, `failure.html`) to provide a user interface for the payment process and to display payment status.

## âœ… **Run Django Application**

Start your Django development server, visit the `create_payment` view, and follow the PayPal payment process. Make sure to use PayPal's sandbox environment for testing.

## âœ… In Summary

This is a basic integration of PayPal with Django using the REST API. 
Depending on your requirements, you can explore additional features such as handling webhooks, handling multiple currencies, and customizing the payment process further. 

Be sure to refer to the [PayPal REST API documentation](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/overview/) for more details on advanced features and customization options.
