## Introduction

This section presents more insights regarding `MongoDB` and the power features compared to a `Relational Database` like MySql or PostgreSQL.  

### âœ… What is MongoDB

`MongoDB` is an open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database that was designed for scalability and high availability. 
MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which makes it easy for developers to work with data because it does not require a fixed schema. 
This means you can store data without having to define a strict structure, which is different from traditional SQL databases.

MongoDB supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, ad-hoc queries, and indexing, making it an excellent choice for modern web and mobile applications. 
It is widely used across various industries because of its flexibility, scalability, and fast performance. 

### âœ… MongoDB vs Relational DBMS

> **Data Model** 

Relational databases use a tabular data model, where data is organized into tables with columns and rows. MongoDB uses a document-based data model, where data is stored as documents that can have varying structures and are typically organized in collections.

> **Storage Architecture** 

`Relational Databases` use a fixed schema to enforce data consistency and use ACID transactions to ensure data integrity. 
The acronym ACID refers to the four key properties of a transaction: atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability
`MongoDB` uses a flexible schema that allows for faster development and easier data evolution.

> **Query Language** 

Relational Databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) to query data, which is a declarative language that allows users to specify what data they want to retrieve. 
`MongoDB` uses a query language called the MongoDB Query Language (MQL), which is a JSON-based language that allows for complex queries of document-based data.

> **Use cases** 

Relational databases are well-suited for transactional systems, such as online banking or e-commerce applications, where data consistency and integrity are critical.
`MongoDB` is better suited for use cases where data is less structured and more varied, such as social media or content management systems, where the flexibility of the document model allows for faster development and easier data evolution.

## Install MongoDB

For this tutorial, you need MongoDB installed on your device to get started. To install MongoDB follow the links below and follow the steps outlined to get it done.

- [Install Mongo on Windows](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/#install-mongodb-community-edition)
- [Install on Linux, Ubuntu](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)

Alternatively, use the [Community Version Installer](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community), under `MongoDB Community Server Download`, 
using the dropdown menu select your platform and installation package. This provides a graphical user interface for the installation.

- **On Windows**, tick the box `Install MongoDB as a Service`, this ensures MongoB is started automatically.
- **On Linux**, after installation is complete, run the following commands 

```bash
$ sudo service mongod start
// OR
$ sudo systemctl start mongod
```

<br />

## MongoDB shell

`Mongosh`, the MongoDB shell is used to interact with the **MongoDB** server from the terminal. For Linux, it is installed with the MongoDB server.
For Windows `mongosh` is not installed with the MongoDB server, and needs to be installed from this location:

- [Mongosh download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell)
  - Under `MongoDB Shell Download` using the dropdown menu, select the preferred platform and installation package.
  - After the download is complete, double-click the file and follow the instructions to install the MongoDB shell

To use `mongosh` with Windows, you need to add it to PATH. follow the instructions [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/#add-the-mongosh-binary-to-your-path-environment-variable) to add `mongosh` to PATH.

Once installation is complete, run the command below to ensure `mongosh` was installed correctly.

```bash
$ mongosh
...
test> // mongosh cli
test> exit() // exits mongosh
```

This shows that `mongosh` has successfully connected to the MongoDB server. Now you are ready to start development with MongoDB installed on your device.

<br />

## Create a `Django` Project

From the terminal run the following commands to create a new folder, change the directory into the new folder and create a new virtual environment

```bash
$ mkdir django-mongo-integration
$ cd django-mongo-integration
$ virtualenv venv
```

The command below activates the virtual environment

> `For Linux/Mac`:

```bash
$ source env/bin/activate
(venv) $ # ready for commands
```

> `For Windows`:

```bash
$ env\\Scripts\\activate
(venv) $ # ready for commands
```

Now that the virtual environment is activated, we can start installing the packages needed. 
Execute the following commands on your terminal to install Django and create a new Django project.

```bash
(venv) $ pip install django
(venv) $ django-admin startproject core .
```

The project is created in the current directory because of `.` added to the command.

<br />

### âœ… Add dependencies for `MongoDB`

Django was built to integrate seamlessly with Relational Databases. 
To use MongoDB with Django and still leverage features like the database modeling, admin panel and so on, we will be needing a package called `Djongo`. 
The proceeding steps will help us install and configure our Django project to use `Djongo`.

* Run the command below to install Djongo
```bash
(venv) $ pip install pymongo 
(venv) $ pip install djongo
```

<br />

### âœ… Update Configuration for `MongoDB`

Open `core/settings.py` and make the following changes to allow Django uses `djongo` as the database engine.

```py
# core/settings.py
...
DATABASES = {
  'default': {
    'ENGINE': 'djongo',
    'NAME': 'your-db-name',
  }
}
...
```

<br />

### âœ… Create a Superuser

Before creating a superuser, we need to apply the default database migration.
Run the command below to apply database migration and then create a superuser

```bash
(venv) $ python manage.py makemigrations
(venv) $ python manage.py migrate
(venv) $ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

At this point, the our MongoDB database should be provisioned with the new tables, and also you would have created a `superuser`. 
Now you can start the application and visit the admin panel using the superuser details entered earlier.

<br />

## Checking the information

just to double check the set up, we can access the `admin` section (reserved for superusers) or use the Django CLI to inspect the information. 

### âœ… Accessing the `ADMIN` Section

Run the application using the command below

```
(venv) $ python manage.py runserver
```

When the Django server starts running, open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`. 
This is the route to the admin section. Once you log in you will see the admin panel, which lets you perform several actions, including adding users, deleting users, and assigning and removing roles.

<br />

<br />

### âœ… Visualizing the data in `MongoDB`

To see the data added to your database, open your terminal and run the following command

> `Start up the MongoDB Shell` using the command `mongosh`

```bash
$ mongosh <db_name> # replace db_name with the database name registered with the database engine
db_name> // shows you MongoDB shell has started
```

The command below will show you all the collections created when we made the database migration.

```bash
db_name> show tables
__schema__
auth_group
auth_group_permissions
auth_permission
auth_user
auth_user_groups
auth_user_user_permissions
django_admin_log
django_content_type
django_migrations
django_session
db_name>
```

> `List all the users created` 

```bash
db_name> db.auth_user.find()
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId("643f1d48e846350f2ed32428"),
    id: 1,
    password: 'pbkdf2_sha256$************************************',
    last_login: ISODate("2023-04-19T08:50:31.196Z"),
    is_superuser: true,
    username: 'admin',
    first_name: '',
    last_name: '',
    email: 'admin@admin.com',
    is_staff: true,
    is_active: true,
    date_joined: ISODate("2023-04-18T22:44:23.958Z")
  }
]
db_name>
```

This command will return a list of all the users registered. For now, we have only created the superuser, hence we have only one record in the database.

<br />

## Style the Project

This section explains how to style the project with a an open-source theme that covers the admin section but also the rest of the website.

The theme to be added is the [Django Soft Dashboard](https://github.com/app-generator/django-admin-soft-dashboard), a modern **Bootstrap 5** Design from Creative-Tim, migrated to Django. 

The proceeding steps will guide you in integrating this theme with your Django project.

> âœ… `Install the theme`

```bash
(venv) $ pip install django-admin-soft-dashboard
```

> âœ… `Update Settings` 

After installation, we need to make changes to our project files to allow the project to recognize and use the theme. Open the file `core/settings.py` and make the following changes.

```python
# core/settings.py
# ... (truncated content)

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'admin_soft.apps.AdminSoftDashboardConfig', # <-- New
    'django.contrib.admin',
    ...
]

# ... (truncated content)

LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'

# ... (truncated content) 
```

> âœ… `Edit Routes`

Next step is to add a route that points to the theme. Open `core/urls.py and make the following change

```py
# core/urls.py
# ... (truncated content)

from django.urls import path, include # make sure you have the INCLUDE directive

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('admin_soft.urls')), # <-- New
]
```

Now that all these changes have been made, open your browser and head to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the changes made. 
You can also check the admin dashboard by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`. 

At this point, our Django & MongoDB project is also styled with a nice, modern design.
