# How to Write Raw SQL Queries in Django ORM

<SubHeading>Learn how to use Django ORM via Raw SQL Queries</SubHeading>

In Django, you can execute raw SQL queries using the `django.db.connection` object or by using the `RawSQL` expression.

> **Here's how to do both**:

## ✅ Method 1: Using `django.db.connection`

You can execute raw SQL queries using the `django.db.connection` object. This method is useful when you need to perform custom queries that don't fit within the typical ORM structure. 

Here's an example:

```python
from django.db import connection

# Your raw SQL query
raw_sql = "SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE your_condition;"

# Execute the query
with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(raw_sql)
    results = cursor.fetchall()
```

Replace `your_table` with the name of your database table and `your_condition` with the desired SQL condition.

## ✅ Method 2: Using `RawSQL` expression

The `RawSQL` expression allows you to include raw SQL in a query while still using the Django ORM. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
from django.db.models import RawSQL
from yourapp.models import YourModel

# Your raw SQL expression
raw_sql = RawSQL("SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE your_condition;", [])

# Use the raw SQL expression in a query
results = YourModel.objects.raw(raw_sql)
```

In this example:

- `your_table` is the name of your database table.
- `your_condition` is the SQL condition you want to apply.

The `RawSQL` expression can be used in queries to include custom SQL expressions.

Remember to replace `your_table`, `your_condition`, and `YourModel` with your actual table name, SQL condition, and model class, respectively.

Using raw SQL queries should be done with caution, as it bypasses some of Django's built-in protections against SQL injection and can make your code less portable between different database backends. Always validate and sanitize user inputs when constructing raw SQL queries to prevent security risks.
