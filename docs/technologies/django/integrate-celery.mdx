## ✅ Introduction

Django is a leading web framework and it has a lot of features built into it. 
Although Django is a fast and scalable web framework, certain tasks can increase the strain on the web servers and also reduce the response time of our Django application. 

Celery is a package that aims to solve this problem.

### What is Celery?

Celery is a task queue, it is a powerful tool for managing asynchronous tasks in Django. 
It can help developers to build more scalable and efficient applications by running time-consuming tasks on separate processes.

Celery works by using a message queue, such as RabbitMQ or Redis(also known as brokers), to distribute tasks across worker processes. 
When a task is submitted, it is added to the queue, and a worker process executes it. This allows tasks to be executed asynchronously, without blocking the main Django process or affecting the responsiveness of the application.

Tasks such as sending emails, processing data, or generating reports, can be time-consuming and thus reduce the response time of the Django application. 
These tasks can be sent to worker processes to be done asynchronously and also speed up our Django application.

### Why using Celery?

- Celery increases the responsiveness of the application by handling processes that will normally block the Django process.
- It allows developers to schedule tasks to run at a specific time or interval.
- It provides mechanisms for retrying failed tasks and handling errors.
- It can also store the results of tasks in a backend such as Redis, so they can be retrieved later.

Using Django and Celery will improve the user experience of your application and also reduce the on Django servers. Django and Celery can integrate seamlessly because Django is supported out of the box.

### Django Async Vs. Celery

Django Async, provides a built-in way to handle asynchronous tasks, without relying on third-party libraries like Celery. 
It uses async/await syntax and the asyncio library to run tasks in the background, inside the same Django process as the web server. 
This means that there is no need to set up a separate task queue, broker, or worker process, as is the case with Celery.

Celery, on the other hand, is a mature, battle-tested, and widely-used distributed task queue platform that provides a feature-rich and robust solution for 
running asynchronous tasks in Django and other Python applications. It requires a separate server and worker processes to execute tasks, usually on a different machine or cluster of machines, 
which increases its scalability and performance.

Some other key differences between Django Async and Celery are:

- Django Async only supports asyncio-based code, while Celery supports a wider range of task execution strategies, including threads, processes, and coroutines.
- Django Async is easier to set up and configure, as it does not require any extra dependencies or infrastructure. Celery, however, requires additional configuration and setup, such as a message broker (e.g. RabbitMQ, Redis, or SQS) which can store the task messages and dispatch them to workers.
- Django Async is more suitable for smaller applications or simple use cases, while Celery is better suited for more complex, high-throughput applications that require scalability and durability.

In summary, Django Async provides a simple, built-in solution for handling asynchronous tasks, while Celery provides a more robust and scalable solution for large, complex web applications.

## ✅ Setting up the Environment

To use Celery, you need a broker such as RabbitMQ or Redis. There are several other brokers, s
see [Celery Broker Overview](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/index.html#broker-overview) for a full list. For this tutorial, we will be using Redis.

### Redis Installation

Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a distributed, in-memory key-value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. 
Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indices.
It can be used as a database, cache, streaming engine, and **message broker**.

Redis and Celery are not supported on Windows, Although you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and follow the steps for Linux. 
Follow this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to set up WSL for your machine and follow the steps for Linux to install Redis on your machine.

For `Linux`:

From your terminal execute the following commands
```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install redis
```
Once Redis is installed, you can check if it is running using the command below:
```bash
$ sudo service redis status
```
If Redis is not running, run the command below
```bash
$ sudo service redis start
```

Redis by default runs on port `6379`, so this is the port we will use to access the Redis service.

Using `Docker`:
The command below will start a new Docker container with Redis installed, and link port `6379` to the port Redis uses in the Docker container.
```bash
$ docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis
```

### Create a Django project

- First, we will be creating the project directory using the command below
```bash
$ mkdir sample_django_task_manager
$ cd sample_django_task_manager
sample_django_task_manager$
```
- Next, we will be creating a Virtual environment to isolate our development packages from other packages.

```bash
sample_django_task_manager$ virtualenv venv
sample_django_task_manager$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv)sample_django_task_manager$
```

- Run the command below to install the packages that will be needed for the project
```bash
(venv)sample_django_task_manager$ pip install django celery redis django-celery-results
```
`celery` will be used to start worker processes, `redis` will be serving as the connector to our Redis service that is running, `django-celery-results` will be used to view the results of tasks carried out by celery workers.

- Next, we will create our Django project
```bash
(venv) sample_django_task_manager$ django-admin start project core .
```

### Django & Celery Integration

We will now be making changes to our project to allow it to work with celery.

- Create a file inside the `core` directory called `celery.py` and add the following code
```py
# core/celery.py
import os

from celery import Celery

# Set the default Django settings module for the 'celery' program.
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'core.settings')

app = Celery('core')

# Using a string here means the worker doesn't have to serialize
# the configuration object to child processes.
# - namespace='CELERY' means all celery-related configuration keys
#   should have a `CELERY_` prefix.
app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')

# Load task modules from all registered Django apps.
app.autodiscover_tasks()


@app.task(bind=True)
def debug_task(self):
    print(f'Request: {self.request!r}')
```
`@app.task(bind=True)` Attaches the `debug_task` function to the celery app object created earlier. We will be looking at a different way to create tasks without binding them to a particular app as we proceed in this tutorial.

- Then you need to import this app in your `/core/__init__.py` module. This ensures that the app is loaded when Django starts so that the `@shared_task` decorator (mentioned later) will use it:
```py
# core/__init__.py
from .celery import app as celery_app

__all__ = ('celery_app',)
```

- Next step is to add the installed packages to the list of installed applications for our Django project. Make the following changes to `core/settings.py`.
```py
# core/settings.py
...
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'django_celery_results',         # Django Celery Results  # <-- NEW    
]
...

CELERY_BROKER_URL         = os.environ.get("CELERY_BROKER", "redis://localhost:6379")
# CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND     = os.environ.get("CELERY_BROKER", "redis://localhost:6379")

CELERY_TASK_TRACK_STARTED = True
CELERY_CACHE_BACKEND      = "django-cache"
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND     = "django-db"
CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT     = ["json"]
CELERY_SERIALIZER         = "json"
```

`CELERY_BROKER_URL` refers to the address of the message broker, `redis` prefixing the address lets the connector installed earlier to connect and make use of the `Redis` instance running on that address.

`CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND ` refers to the storage location of the result of tasks executed by celery. `django-db` is the database used by our Django project, this value can be changed as seen above by the line commented out.

`CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT` is a white list of content-types/serializers to allow. By default, only json is enabled but any content type can be added.

`CELERY_SERIALIZER` is a string identifying the default serialization method to use, this can be changed. Check out the full list of [Serializers](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html#calling-serializers).

Celery can be further customized using a wide range of options, [Celery Configuration](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html) contains a list of the configuration options.

- Now, we will be creating a Django application that will be used to create tasks and see how Celery can help us process tasks and allow to Django run without having to deal will blocking operations.

```
(venv) sample_django_task_manager$ python manage.py startapp django_celery
(venv) sample_django_task_manager$ python manage.py migrate
(venv) sample_django_task_manager$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

- After creating the application and creating a superuser, now we have access to the admin panel. Execute the command below and open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` on your browser.
```
(venv) sample_django_task_manager$ python manage.py runserver
```
- We will be adding `django_celery` to the list of installed applications for our Django project. Make the following changes to `core/settings.py`
```py
# core/settings.py
...

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_celery',  # <-- NEW
]
...
```

- Create a file `tasks.py` inside the `django_celery` folder. This folder will contain the tasks we want to be handled by the celery workers. Add the function below to the `django_celery/tasks.py`
```py
# django_celery/tasks.py
from time import sleep

def slowdown_django_process():
    sleep(10) # simulates blocking processes

    return {'Status': 'Process slowdown complete'}
```

- Now, we will be creating a view that makes use of the function just created. Add the following content to `django_celery/views.py`
```py
# django_celery/views.py
from django.shortcuts import HttpResponse

from .tasks import slowdown_django_process

def homepage(request):
    slowdown_django_process() # the blocking process
    return HttpResponse('Hello user!')
```

- Create a file named urls.py and add the following, to create a route for the `homepage` function
```py
# django_celery/urls.py
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.homepage),
]
```

- Changes will be made to `core/urls.py` to create a route for `django_celery`
```py
# core/urls.py
...
from django.urls import path, include     # <-- UPDATED: Added 'include' HELPER

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path("", include("django_celery.urls")),
]
```
- If your Django server has been stopped, restart it and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` with your browser. Notice the response time of the webpage to render the words `Hello User!`

Now we will be making changes to our Django application, to use celery to handle blocking tasks and free up the Django process.

- Inside the `django_celery/tasks.py` file, add the following changes
```py
# django_celery/tasks.py
...
from celery import shared_task

@shared_task
def slowdown_django_process():
    time.sleep(10)

    return {'status': 'Process slowdown complete'}
```
`@shared_task` decorator lets you create tasks without having any concrete app instance, this helps when creating reusable apps because the tasks does not depend on the project itself. Celery automatically detects tasks with the `shared_task` decorator.

- Update `django_celery/views.py` with the following code
```py
# django_celery/views.py
...
def homepage(request):
    slowdown_django_process.delay()   # <-- UPDATED
    return HttpResponse('Hello User!')
```
The `delay` method makes the `slowdown_django_process` function to be executed asynchronously using a worker process created by celery.
Now we have our application set up to use celery workers.

- Open a new terminal in the project directory and execute the command below

```bash
(venv) sample_django_task_manager$ celery -A core.celery.app worker --loglevel=info
...
[tasks]
  . core.celery.debug_task
  . django_celery.tasks.slowdown_django_process
...
```

The `-A` option for the `celery` command is the application instance to be used when creating the workers, `core.celery.app` is the app `Celery` instance that was created in `core/celery.py`. `--loglevel=info` helps us get verbose logs on the terminal.

Under `[tasks]` we see all the tasks that have been created being recognized by celery and registered.

- From your browser open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and see how fast you get the response to your request. If you check the terminal running celery, you will see something like

```bash
...
[2023-04-23 18:45:42,120: INFO/MainProcess] Task django_celery.tasks.slowdown_django_process[952c4afe-c7c0-46a7-9373-b0002f8aefa1] received
[2023-04-23 18:45:52,407: INFO/ForkPoolWorker-4] Task django_celery.tasks.slowdown_django_process[952c4afe-c7c0-46a7-9373-b0002f8aefa1] succeeded in 10.285309484999743s
```

This shows the task being executed by celery, the time taken to complete the task and the result of the task, which is the return value of the function `slowdown_django_process`.

- Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` from your browser and click on `Task Results` to see all the tasks executed by celery and other information surrounding the task. Clicking on the `id` of any task will open a new page showing more information concerning that task.

## ✅ [Django Tasks Manager](https://github.com/app-generator/django-tasks-manager)

Django Tasks Manager is a **Django & Celery** integration - This library is actively supported by [AppSeed](https://appseed.us/). 
It can be used to manage tasks, check tasks' status and also the log and result of tasks performed by celery.

> Features: 

- Create/Revoke `Celery Tasks`
- `View LOGS` & Output
- `Minimal Configuration
- Available [TASKS](https://github.com/app-generator/django-tasks-manager/blob/main/django_tm/tasks.py) (provided as starting samples)
  - `users_in_db()` - List all registered users
  - `execute_script()` - let users execute the [scripts](https://github.com/app-generator/django-tasks-manager/tree/main/django_tm/celery_scripts) defined in `CELERY_SCRIPTS_DIR` (CFG parameter)
    - [check-db-health.py](https://github.com/app-generator/django-tasks-manager/blob/main/django_tm/celery_scripts/check-db-health.py) (sample)
    - [check-disk-free.py](https://github.com/app-generator/django-tasks-manager/blob/main/django_tm/celery_scripts/check-disk-free.py) (sample)
    - [clean-database.py](https://github.com/app-generator/django-tasks-manager/blob/main/django_tm/celery_scripts/clean-database.py) (sample)

The samples are there to provide a usage guide, and you can write your tasks and execute them using `Django Tasks Manager`.

### Setting up Django Tasks Manager

- `Django Tasks Manager` can be installed using `pip`, install the package using the command below
```bash
(venv) sample_django_task_manager$ pip install django-tasks-manager
```

- After installation, you need to set it up as an application in `core/settings.py`
```py
# core/settings.py
...
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_tm',                     # Django Tasks Manager   # <-- NEW
    'django_celery_results',    
    'django_celery',
]
...
CELERY_SCRIPTS_DIR        = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "celery_scripts") # path for scripts to be executed
CELERY_LOGS_DIR           = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "celery_logs") # path for log files for each task executed
```
- Next, we need to create the directory where our celery scripts and logs will be saved. In the root directory of the project create the folders `celery_logs` and `celery_scripts`
```bash
# new directory structure
.
├── celery_logs
├── celery_scripts
├── core
├── django_celery
└── manage.py
```

- Add `django_task_manager` URL route to `core/urls.py`, this makes `django_tm` pages to be accessible from `http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks`
```py
# core/urls.py
...
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('', include("django_tm.urls")),  # <-- NEW
]
```

- Stop the celery server using `Ctrl + c`, and restart it, this way it recognizes the tasks registered in `django_tm`. When the Django server and celery are running, head to `http://127.0.0.1/tasks` to see the working application.

![Django Tasks Manages Without scripts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57325382/234071041-9570d8d4-5902-40bb-a050-28136bfa7f29.png)

If you open the webpage, you will notice it contains four tasks, two were created during this tutorial and two were added from `django-tasks-manager`. Another thing to note is that the input to the `execute_script` task is empty, this is because our `celery_scripts` folder is empty.

By adding Python files into the `celery_scripts` folder, we can execute several files from within the task manager, files that can perform a wide range of functions.

- You can add any script of your choosing to the `celery_scripts` folder or use the samples [here](https://github.com/app-generator/django-tasks-manager/blob/main/django_tm/celery_scripts) to get started.

![Django Tasks Manager with scripts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57325382/234071031-843640ab-3963-40c2-a866-5b1cd45dd5a6.png)

After adding those Python scripts, we can now start executing Python scripts using `django-tasks-manager`.

<br />

## ✅ Conclusion

In conclusion, integrating Django and Celery can enhance the functionality and efficiency of your application by allowing you to offload time-consuming or resource-intensive tasks to background workers. 
With Celery handling your asynchronous task queue, Django can focus on serving user requests and generating responses.

To successfully integrate Django and Celery, you need to install and configure Celery to work with your Django project. 
This includes setting up a Celery worker, task queue, broker, and task scheduler. 

Once the setup is complete, you can create and register tasks in Celery's task queue, and use annotations to define and pass arguments to your tasks.

While the integration process can seem complex, it is worth the effort, especially considering the numerous benefits it offers. 
With Django and Celery combined, you can build faster, more responsive, and more scalable web applications to meet the needs of your users.
