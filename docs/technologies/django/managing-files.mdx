# Managing files in Django

<SubHeading>Learn how to manage files in Django (local development and production)</SubHeading>

**Managing files** in a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) Project involves handling file uploads, serving media files during development, and managing static files like CSS and JavaScript. 

Here's a guide on **how to manage files in Django**:

## âœ… **Setting Up the Project**

Before you start managing files, ensure your Django project is set up correctly. In your project's settings (usually found in `settings.py`), make sure you have the following configurations:

```python
# settings.py

# Media Settings
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')

# Static Files Settings
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
```

This configuration sets up the URLs and directories for media and static files.

## âœ… **Uploads (Media Files)**

If you need to handle file uploads, such as user profile pictures or document uploads, you need to define a model field to store these files and set up the media settings as mentioned above.

For example, in a Django model:

```python
from django.db import models

class UserProfile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    profile_picture = models.ImageField(upload_to='profile_pics/')
```

In this example, `profile_picture` is an `ImageField` that will store uploaded images in a `profile_pics` directory within your `MEDIA_ROOT`.

## âœ… **Form Handling for File Uploads**

When handling file uploads in forms, use the `forms.FileField`:

```python
from django import forms

class ProfilePictureForm(forms.Form):
    profile_picture = forms.FileField()
```

## âœ… **Media Files in Development**

During development, Django's built-in development server can serve media files for you. Ensure that the following is in your project's `urls.py`:

```python
# urls.py

from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    # Your other URL patterns here
]

if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

This setup is for development purposes only. In a production environment, you'd typically configure your web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to serve media files.

## âœ… **Managing Static Files**

   Static files, like CSS, JavaScript, and image assets, are typically placed in your app's `static` directory. Ensure your app is included in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `settings.py`.

   For example, if your app is named `myapp`, you'd have a structure like this:

   ```
   myapp/
   â”œâ”€â”€ static/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ myapp/
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ css/
   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ js/
   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ script.js
   â””â”€â”€ ...
   ```

## âœ… **Linking to Static Files**

To include static files in your templates, use the `{% load static %}` template tag at the top of your template and then link to the static files like this:

```html
{% load static %}

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'myapp/css/styles.css' %}">
<script src="{% static 'myapp/js/script.js' %}"></script>
```

## âœ… **Collecting Static Files**

Before deploying your project, you should collect all static files into a single directory. This is done using the following management command:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

It will copy all static files from your apps to the `STATIC_ROOT` directory defined in your settings.

## âœ… In Summary

By following these steps, you can effectively manage files in your Django project, including handling file uploads and serving both media and static files during development and production.
