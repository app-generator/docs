# Integrate Django Debug Toolbar

<SubHeading>Learn how to integrate Django Toolbar, a popular DEBUG library</SubHeading>

Including third-party applications in your **Django** project, such as [django-debug-toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html), 
can be a powerful way to extend the functionality of your application without reinventing the wheel. 

Here's a **step-by-step guide** on how to include and use third-party applications like `django-debug-toolbar` in your project:

## âœ… **Installation**

To include a third-party application, you first need to install it. You can do this using `pip`, which is the package manager for Python. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install django-debug-toolbar
```

Replace `django-debug-toolbar` with the name of the third-party package you want to install.

## âœ… **Update `INSTALLED_APPS` Section**

In your Django project's settings (usually found in `settings.py`), you need to add the third-party application to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list. For example, to include `django-debug-toolbar`, 
add the following line to your settings:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'debug_toolbar',
    # ...
]
```

## âœ… **Configure the Application**

Some third-party applications may require additional configuration. Refer to the documentation of the specific package you're installing to see if any configuration settings are necessary. 

For `django-debug-toolbar`, you typically need to configure it to work only in development mode. Here's how to do that:

```python
if DEBUG:
    MIDDLEWARE += [
        'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',
    ]
    DEBUG_TOOLBAR_CONFIG = {
        'SHOW_TOOLBAR_CALLBACK': lambda request: True,
    }
```

Ensure that `DEBUG` is set to `True` in your development settings and not in production.

## âœ… **Include URLs**
   
Some applications may provide their URLs. If so, you need to include them in your project's `urls.py` file. 

For example, `django-debug-toolbar` provides its URLs, so you can include them as follows:

```python
if settings.DEBUG:
    import debug_toolbar
    urlpatterns = [
        path('__debug__/', include(debug_toolbar.urls)),
        # ...
    ]
```

## âœ… **Run Migrations**

Some third-party applications, especially those that store data in the database, might require you to run migrations to create their database tables. Run the following command to apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## âœ… **Use the new Features**

Now that you've installed and configured the third-party application, you can use its functionality in your Django project. 
Refer to the documentation of the specific application to learn how to use it effectively.

## âœ… **Test in Development**

It's essential to thoroughly test the third-party application in your development environment before deploying it to a production server. Ensure it behaves as expected and doesn't introduce any issues.

## âœ… In Summary

Remember that different third-party applications may have unique installation and configuration instructions, so always refer to their official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information. 

Including third-party applications can save you a lot of development time and add powerful features to your Django project.
