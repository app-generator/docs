# How to write SQL-like Query in Django ORM

<SubHeading>Learn how to use Django ORM via SQL-like Queries</SubHeading>

In Django, you can use the `__icontains` lookup to perform a SQL `LIKE` query to filter results based on a substring match. 
This lookup allows you to search for records that contain a specific string anywhere within a text field.

> Here's how you can write a SQL `LIKE` query using Django ORM:

Assuming you have a Django model called `MyModel` and you want to perform a `LIKE` query on the `field_name` field:

```python
from myapp.models import MyModel

# Use the __icontains lookup to perform a SQL LIKE query
results = MyModel.objects.filter(field_name__icontains='search_term')
```

In the code above:

- `MyModel` is your Django model.
- `field_name` is the name of the field you want to search within.
- `'search_term'` is the substring you want to search for.

The `filter` method returns a QuerySet containing all records that match the `field_name` containing the specified `search_term`. 

The `__icontains` lookup performs a case-insensitive search, so it will match records regardless of the case of the `search_term`.

You can chain additional filters or query conditions to further refine your query. For example:

```python
results = MyModel.objects.filter(field_name__icontains='search_term', another_field=some_value)
```

This query will return records where `field_name` contains the `search_term` and `another_field` is equal to `some_value`.

Remember to replace `MyModel`, `field_name`, `'search_term'`, and any other specific values with your actual model, field name, and search criteria.
