# Django & Plotly

<SubHeading>Learn how to showcase charts with Django & Plotly</SubHeading>

**Django** is a robust web framework that facilitates the rapid and easy development of intricate web applications. 
One common application of Django is in developing data-centric web applications that exhibit information using charts and graphs. 
In this guide, we will delve into the integration of Django with Plotly to create an interactive chart that represents data in a web application.

**Plotly** is a data visualization library that allows you to create interactive, publication-quality graphs and charts in Python, R, and other programming languages. 
With `Plotly`, you can create a wide variety of visualizations including line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, box plots, and more.

One of the key features of Plotly is its ability to create interactive visualizations. 
This means that you can add hover-over tooltips, zoom in and out, pan across the graph, and even click on data points to display more detailed information. 
These interactive features make it easier to explore and understand your data. `The source code for this tutorial can be found on GitHub`:

## ✅ Introduction

`Plotly` also offers a wide range of customization options, allowing you to change colors, fonts, and layouts to create graphs that match your specific needs. 
Additionally, you can easily embed Plotly graphs in web applications or share them with others by exporting them to various file formats such as PNG, SVG, or PDF.

Overall, `Plotly` is a powerful data visualization library that offers many features and customization options to help you create beautiful, 
interactive visualizations that effectively communicate insights from your data.

In this tutorial, we will be making use of [Django Material Starter](https://appseed.us/product/material-dashboard/django/), 
and we will be modifying its homepage to create sales charts using data from Django models.

To begin, we will initiate a new Django project and establish a fresh application to act as the homepage for our program.
Subsequently, we will devise a model to preserve our sales data and a view to serve this data to the front-end. Lastly, utilizing Plotly, we will produce an interactive line chart, bar chart, and pie chart that will showcase data sourced from the sales model.

<br />

## ✅ Setting up `Django`

You can create a new folder, change the directory into the new folder, and create a new virtual environment by running the following commands in the terminal:

> To create a new folder, use the "mkdir" command followed by the name you want to give to the folder.

```bash
$ mkdir django-charts
```

> To change the directory into the new folder, use the "cd" command followed by the name of the folder you just created.

```bash
$ cd django-charts
```

> To create a new virtual environment, you can use the `virtualenv` module bundled with Python.

```bash
$ virtualenv venv
```

This will create a new virtual environment in a folder called "venv" inside your "django-charts" folder.

This command is used to activate the virtual environment

- On `MacOS`/`Linux`

```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $
```

- On `Windows`

```bash
(venv) $ ./venv/Scripts/activate
(venv) $
```

After activating the virtual environment, you can proceed to install the required packages. 
To install Django and `material-design` and also create a new Django project, run the following commands on your terminal.

```bash
(venv) $ pip install django django-admin-material-dashboard
(venv) $ django-admin startproject core .
```

Once the Django project has been created, the next step is to create a new Django application and modify the project to recognize the application and the `material dashboard` that was installed earlier.

> Create a new Django application by executing the command

```bash
(venv) $ python manage.py startapp home
```

> Open `core/settings.py` and make the following changes

```py
# core/settings.py
import os             # <-- NEW import
...
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "home",
    "admin_material.apps.AdminMaterialDashboardConfig",
    ...
]
...
UI_TEMPLATES = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "templates")  # <-- NEW

TEMPLATES = [
    {
        "BACKEND": "django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates",
        "DIRS": [UI_TEMPLATES],     # <-- UPDATED
        ...
    }
]
...
STATIC_URL = "/static/"
STATICFILES_DIRS = (
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static"),
)
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'
...
```

> Make the following changes to `core/urls.py` to add routes to the application created and `material dashboard`

```py
# core/urls.py
from django.urls import include, path   <-- UPDATED add path

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include('home.urls')),
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("", include('admin_material.urls'))
]
```

> We will be creating a view to the homepage of the web application inside `home/views.py`.

```py
# home/views.py
...
def index(request):

    # Page from the theme 
    return render(request, 'pages/index.html')

```

> Create the file `urls.py` inside `home` folder and create a route to the index view created.

```py
# home/urls.py
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

Run the Django server from your terminal by executing the command
```bash
(venv) $ python manage.py runserver
```
From your browser, head to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, this shows the theme installed. You will see the `material dashboard` theme. 
As we progress through this tutorial, we will learn how to utilize data from our Django models to make the charts dynamic.

<br />

## ✅ Creating a new Model

The application already has static charts, to display dynamic sales data in our Django and Chart.js web application, we need to first create a model to store the data in our database.

### Defining Model Schema

- We will be using Django Object Relational Mapper to define the structure of the database. Open `home/models.py` and make the changes
```py
# home/models.py
from django.db import models

class Sales(models.Model):
    product = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    price = models.IntegerField()
    currency = models.CharField(
        choices=(('USD', 'USD'), ('EUR', 'EUR')),
        default='USD',
        max_length=3
    )
    country = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    purchase_date = models.DateTimeField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.product

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = 'Sale'
        verbose_name_plural = 'Sales'
```

<br />

### Populating the Database

- Now we need to register the database so we can access it from the admin panel. Make the following changes to `home/admin.py`
```py
# home/admin.py
...
from .models import Sales # <-- NEW import

admin.site.register(Sales)
```

- Stop your Django server using `Ctrl + c` and run the command to create Django default tables and the `Sales` table just created.
```bash
(venv) $ python manage.py makemigrations
(venv) $ python manage.py migrate
```

- Next step we will be creating a superuser, this will enable us to have access to the admin panel
```bash
(venv) $ python manage.py createsuperuser
(venv) $ python manage.py runserver
```

With your browser visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`, You will see the sales table just created.

![Admin dashboard showing sales model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57325382/234968310-2806aec3-2165-4dfd-bde6-294a61f4deb0.png)

- Now you can use the `add sale` button from the admin panel to populate the database with data

![Admin dashboard with populated data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57325382/234968317-be8dfc18-da96-4570-9db1-10354888c0d4.png)

<br />

### Using Plotly with a Django application

To use Plotly in a Django application, we need to install a package called `djang_plotly_dash` using `pip`. 
The purpose of this package is to enable Plotly dash applications to be served as part of a Django application.

<br />

### Installation and setup of `django_plotly_dash`

- From the terminal execute the command
```bash
(venv) $ pip install django_plotly_dash
```

- We will be adding `djang_plotly_dash` to the list of installed applications, and also be making changes in `core/settings.py` to allow the use of frames within HTML documents
```py
# core/settings.py
...
INSTALLED_APPS = [
...
'django_plotly_dash.apps.DjangoPlotlyDashConfig',
]
...
#Add PLOTLY_COMPONENTS
PLOTLY_COMPONENTS = [
    'dash_core_components',
    'dash_html_components',
    'dash_renderer',
    'dpd_components'
]

X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'SAMEORIGIN'
...
```
- Next step is adding a route to dash apps created by `django_plotly_dash`. The following changes will be made in `core/urls.py`
```py
# core/urls.py
...
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path("django_plotly_dash/", include("django_plotly_dash.urls")),
]
```
- Now that the applications have been created, we need to apply migration, to create the database tables for `django_plotly_dash`. From the terminal execute the command
```bash
(venv) $ python manage.py makemigrations
(venv) $ python manage.py migrate
```

<br />

## ✅ Creating Charts with Plotly

Copy `index.html` file from `venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/admin_material/templates` and paste it into `templates/pages`. 
Now our `index.html` page for the application will be served by the file in `templates` folder.

<br />

### Plotly Bar Chart 

> Create a file `plotly_plot.py` inside the `home` folder, this is where the functions for generating charts will be written. Add the code

```py
# home/plotly_plot.py
import plotly.graph_objs as go
from plotly.offline import plot


def plot_barchart(x, y, title, x_label, y_label):
    fig = go.Figure(data=go.Bar(name='BarChart', x=x, y=y))

    fig.update_layout(
        title_text = title,
        xaxis_title = x_label,
        yaxis_title = y_label,
        template=None,
        margin=dict(l=40, r=20, t=30, b=40),
    )

    barchart = plot({'data': fig}, output_type='div')
    return barchart
```

`plot_barchart` function takes five arguments, `x` and `y` are lists, they represent the values on the x-axis and y-axis respectively. `title` is the title of the chart, which should be a string. `x_label` and `y_label` are strings and they represent the labels of the values on the x-axis and y-axis respectively

> Inside `home/views.py`  we will be making changes to the `index` function to add the bar chart created with the `plot_barchart` function.

```py
# home/views.py
...
from .models import Sales

from .plotly_plot import plot_barchart

def index(request):
    sales_query = Sales.objects.values('product', 'price', 'purchase_date')

    total_sales_per_product = {}
    for result in sales_query:
        product_name = result['product']

        # total sales by product
        if total_sales_per_product.get(product_name):
            total_sales_per_product[product_name] += result['price']
        else:
            total_sales_per_product[product_name] = result['price']


    products = list(total_sales_per_product.keys())
    product_sales = list(total_sales_per_product.values())
    bar_chart = plot_barchart(
        products,
        product_sales,
        'Sales per product',
        'Product',
        'Sales'
        )

    # Page from the theme 
    return render(request, 'index.html', {
        'barchart': bar_chart
        })
```

> Now we will be making changes to `templates/index.html`. Using the `barchart` context to display the chart on our webpage. We will be replacing the charts already present on the home page by making changes to specific lines in `Index.html`. On line 84, make the following changes

```html
<!--templates/index.html-->
            ...
                <div class="chart">
                  {{ barchart|safe }}
                </div>
            ...
```
`{{ barchart|safe }}` is put inside the div where the previous chart canvas was present.

<br />

### Creating a Line chart with Plotly

For line chart, we will be creating another function inside the `home/plotly_plot.py` file.

```py
# home/plotly_plot.py
...
def plot_linechart(x, y, title, x_label, y_label):
    fig = go.Figure(data=go.Line(name='LineChart', x=x, y=y))
    fig.update_layout(
        title_text = title,
        xaxis_title = x_label,
        yaxis_title = y_label,
        template=None,
        margin=dict(l=40, r=20, t=30, b=40),
    )

    linechart = plot({'data': fig}, output_type='div')
    return linechart
```
`x`, `y`, `title`, `x_label`, and `y_label` have the same meaning as they did for the `plot_barchart` function.

> Changes will be made to the `index` function in `home/views.py` to send a line chart as part of the context to the template.

```py
# home/views.py
...
from .plotly_plot import plot_barchart, plot_linechart # <-- UPDATED
...
def index(request):
    sales_query = Sales.objects.values('product', 'price', 'purchase_date')

    total_sales_per_product = {}
    total_sales_per_day = {}
    for result in sales_query:
        product_name = result['product']
        day = result['purchase_date'].strftime('%a')
        ...
        if day in total_sales_per_day:
            total_sales_per_day[day] += result['price']
        else:
            total_sales_per_day[day] = result['price']

    # sales per day
    key = {
        'Mon': 1,
        'Tue': 2,
        'Wed': 3,
        'Thu': 4,
        'Fri': 5,
        'Sat': 6,
        'Sun': 7
    }
    days = sorted(total_sales_per_day, key=key.get) # sorting by days, so the result shows in order of days of the week
    sales_day, labels_day = [], []
    for k in days:
        sales_day.append(total_sales_per_day[k])
        labels_day.append(k)
    ...

    line_chart = plot_linechart(
        labels_day,
        sales_day,
        "Total sales per days",
        "Days",
        "Sales"
        )

    # Page from the theme 
    return render(request, 'index.html', {
        'barchart': bar_chart,
        'linechart': line_chart,    # <-- NEW Added
        })
```

> Line 105 in `templates/index.html` add the following code

```html
<!--templates/index.html-->
                <div class="chart">
                  {{ linechart|safe }}
                </div>
```

<br />

### Creating a Pie chart with Plotly

Creating a pie chart with Plotly will follow the same pattern as `bar chart` and `line chart` with a little difference in the function that generates the chart.

- Create the `plot_piechart` function in `home/plotly_plot.py`
```py
# home/plotly_plot.py
def plot_piechart(names, values, title, legend):
    fig = go.Figure(data=go.Pie(name='PieChart', values=values, labels=names))

    fig.update_layout(
        title_text = title,
        template=None,
        margin=dict(l=40, r=20, t=30, b=40),
    )

    piechart = plot({'data': fig}, output_type='div')
    return piechart
```
`names` is a list and it contains the label for the data to be represented by the sectors of the pie chart. `values` is the data values for each label in `names`. `legend` shows a color-encoded description of what each sector of the pie chart represents.

- ✅ For a pie chart, we will be using the same data that was used to create the bar chart. Make the following changes to the `index` function in `home/views.py`

```py
# home/views.py
...
from .plotly_plot import plot_barchart, plot_linechart, plot_piechart # <-- UPDATED
...
def index(request):
    ...
    pie_chart = plot_piechart(
        products,
        product_sales,
        "Product sales distribution",
        total_sales_per_product
        )

    # Page from the theme 
    return render(request, 'index.html', {
        'barchart': bar_chart,
        'linechart': line_chart,
        'piechart': pie_chart       # <-- NEW added
        })
```

Now we have access to the piechart from `templates/index.html` using the `piechart` context

- ✅ On `Line 127` in `templates/index.html` make the following changes

```html
<!--templates/index.html-->
                <div class="chart">
                  {{ piechart|safe }}
                </div>
```

Below is the full code for `home/views.py`:

```py
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

from .models import Sales

from .plotly_plot import plot_barchart, plot_linechart, plot_piechart

# Create your views here.

def index(request):
    sales_query = Sales.objects.values('product', 'price', 'purchase_date')

    total_sales_per_product = {}
    total_sales_per_day = {}
    for result in sales_query:
        product_name = result['product']
        day = result['purchase_date'].strftime('%a')

        # total sales by product
        if total_sales_per_product.get(product_name):
            total_sales_per_product[product_name] += result['price']
        else:
            total_sales_per_product[product_name] = result['price']

        if day in total_sales_per_day:
            total_sales_per_day[day] += result['price']
        else:
            total_sales_per_day[day] = result['price']


    # sales per day
    key = {
        'Mon': 1,
        'Tue': 2,
        'Wed': 3,
        'Thu': 4,
        'Fri': 5,
        'Sat': 6,
        'Sun': 7
    }

    days = sorted(total_sales_per_day, key=key.get) # sorting by days, so the result shows in order of days of the week
    sales_day, labels_day = [], []
    for k in days:
        sales_day.append(total_sales_per_day[k])
        labels_day.append(k)

    products = list(total_sales_per_product.keys())
    product_sales = list(total_sales_per_product.values())
    bar_chart = plot_barchart(
        products,
        product_sales,
        'Sales per product',
        'Product',
        'Sales'
        )

    line_chart = plot_linechart(
        labels_day,
        sales_day,
        "Total sales per day",
        "Days",
        "Sales"
        )

    pie_chart = plot_piechart(
        products,
        product_sales,
        "Product sales distribution",
        total_sales_per_product
        )

    # Page from the theme 
    return render(request, 'index.html', {
        'barchart': bar_chart,
        'linechart': line_chart,
        'piechart': pie_chart
        })

```
