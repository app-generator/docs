## Introduction
Django is a powerful web framework that allows developers to build complex web applications quickly and easily. One popular use case for Django is building data-driven web applications that display information in charts and graphs. In this tutorial, we will explore how to use Django and Chart.js together to build a web application that displays data in an interactive chart.

Before we get started, let's briefly introduce Chart.js. Chart.js is a JavaScript library that allows developers to create beautiful and responsive charts and graphs using HTML5 canvas. It provides a wide range of chart types, including line, bar, pie, radar, and more. Chart.js is easy to use and highly customizable, making it a popular choice for data visualization on the web.

In this tutorial, we will be making use of [Django material dashboard](https://github.com/app-generator/django-material-dashboard), and we will be modifying its homepage to create sales charts using data from Django models.

To get started, we will first set up a new Django project and create a new app that will serve as the homepage of our application. We will then create a model to store our sales data and create a view to serve the data to our front-end. Finally, we will use Chart.js to create an interactive bar chart, line chart and pie chart that displays data from the sales model.

## Setting up a Django project
You can create a new folder, change the directory into the new folder, and create a new virtual environment by running the following commands in the terminal:

1. To create a new folder, use the "mkdir" command followed by the name you want to give to the folder.
```bash
$ mkdir django-charts
```

2. To change the directory into the new folder, use the "cd" command followed by the name of the folder you just created.
```bash
$ cd django-charts
```

3. To create a new virtual environment, you can use the `virtualenv` module bundled with Python.
```bash
django-charts$ virtualenv venv
```

This will create a new virtual environment in a folder called "venv" inside your "django-charts" folder.

This command is used to activate the virtual environment

On `MacOS`/`Linux`
```bash
django-charts$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) django-charts$
```
On `Windows`
```bash
(venv) django-charts$ ./venv/Scripts/activate
(venv) django-charts$
```

After activating the virtual environment, you can proceed to install the required packages. To install Django and `material-design` and also create a new Django project, run the following commands on your terminal.

```bash
(venv) django-charts$ pip install django django-admin-material-dashboard
(venv) django-charts$ django-admin startproject core .
```

Once the Django project has been created, the next step is to create a new Django application and modify the project to recognize the application and the `material dashboard` that was installed earlier.

1. Create a new Django application by executing the command
```bash
(venv) django-charts$ python manage.py startapp home
```

2. Open `core/settings.py` and make the following changes
```py
# core/settings.py
import os             # <-- NEW import
...
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "home",
    "admin_material.apps.AdminMaterialDashboardConfig",
    ...
]
...
UI_TEMPLATES = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "templates")  # <-- NEW

TEMPLATES = [
    {
        "BACKEND": "django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates",
        "DIRS": [UI_TEMPLATES],     # <-- UPDATED
        ...
    }
]
...
STATIC_URL = "/static/"
STATICFILES_DIRS = (
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static"),
)
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'
...
```

3. Make the following changes to `core/urls.py` to add routes to the application created and `material dashboard`
```py
# core/urls.py
from django.urls import include, path   <-- UPDATED add path

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include('home.urls')),
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("", include('admin_material.urls'))
]
```

4. We will be creating a view to the homepage of the web application inside `home/views.py`.
```py
# home/views.py
...
def index(request):

    # Page from the theme 
    return render(request, 'pages/index.html')

```

5. Create the file `urls.py` inside `home` folder and create a route to the index view created.
```py
# home/urls.py
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

Run the Django server from your terminal by executing the command
```bash
(venv) django-charts$ python manage.py runserver
```
From your browser, head to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, this shows the theme installed. You will see the `material dashboard` theme. As we progress through this tutorial, we will learn how to utilize data from our Django models to make the charts dynamic.

## Creating a model to store sales data
The application already has static charts, to display dynamic sales data in our Django and Chart.js web application, we need to first create a model to store the data in our database.

### Defining Model Schema
- We will be using Django Object Relational Mapper to define the structure of the database. Open `home/models.py` and make the changes
```py
# home/models.py
from django.db import models

class Sales(models.Model):
    product = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    price = models.IntegerField()
    currency = models.CharField(
        choices=(('USD', 'USD'), ('EUR', 'EUR')),
        default='USD',
        max_length=3
    )
    country = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    purchase_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = 'Sale'
        verbose_name_plural = 'Sales'
```

### Population the database with sales data
- Now we need to register the database so we can access it from the admin panel. Make the following changes to `home/admin.py`
```py
# home/admin.py
...
from .models import Sales # <-- NEW import

admin.site.register(Sales)
```

- Stop your Django server using `Ctrl + c` and run the command to create Django default tables and the `Sales` table just created.
```bash
(venv) django-charts$ python manage.py makemigrations
(venv) django-charts$ python manage.py migrate
```

- Next step we will be creating a superuser, this will enable us to have access to the admin panel
```bash
(venv) django-charts$ python manage.py createsuperuser
(venv) django-charts$ python manage.py runserver
```

With your browser visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`, You will see the sales table just created.

- Now you can use the `add sale` button from the admin panel to populate the database with data
