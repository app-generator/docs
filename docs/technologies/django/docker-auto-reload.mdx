This guide will walk you through the steps to run a Django application in a Docker container while maintaining code persistence. You will have automatic reloading every time you make changes to your code.

Step 1: Create a Django Project
-------------------------------

To get started, clone our example code by running the following command:

`$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/django-corporate-dashboard`

This will create a new folder called "django-corporate-dashboard" with the project code.

Step 2: Dockerize the Django Project
------------------------------------

Next, navigate to the project directory and run the application with the following command:

```
$ cd django-corporate-dashboard
$ docker compose up -d --build
```

Make sure the container is running properly. You can now open your browser and access the application at [http://localhost:5085](http://localhost:5085/).

Step 3: Change the Code
-----------------------

To see the auto-reload feature in action, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the `templates/includes/head.html` file in your project directory.
2.  Open the file in a text editor and make changes to the title tag.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Refresh your browser, and you will see the updated changes.

The Concept
-----------

Let's understand how the auto-reload feature works. It utilizes the `docker volume` and `gunicorn reload` features.

1.  In the `Dockerfile`, you will find the following configuration:

```
WORKDIR /app
RUN chmod +x /app/entrypoint.sh
CMD ["bash", "-c", "/app/entrypoint.sh"]
```

These configurations ensure that the application is stored in the `/app` directory and that the `entrypoint.sh` script is executed every time the container is run.

1.  In the `entrypoint.sh` file, you will find the following code:

```
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Function to start Gunicorn with dynamic reload-extra-file options
start_gunicorn() {
    # Generate the reload-extra-file options dynamically
    extra_files=$(find /app/templates -name "*.html" -printf "--reload-extra-file %p ")

    # Start Gunicorn
    echo "Starting Gunicorn..."
    gunicorn --config gunicorn-cfg.py --reload --reload-engine=poll $extra_files core.wsgi
}

# Start Gunicorn
start_gunicorn
```

This code scans all files with the `.html` extension, and whenever any of these files change, Gunicorn will automatically reload the server. We don't need to add `.py` files in the `entrypoint.sh` because Gunicorn automatically detects changes in `.py` files.

1.  In the `docker-compose.yml` file, you will find the following configuration:

```
volumes:
  - ./:/app
```

This configuration maps the files inside the Docker container, located at `/app`, to the current directory `./` on your host machine.

Conclusion
----------

That concludes the explanation of how to use the auto-reload feature with Docker. Now you can make changes to your Django code, and the server will automatically reload, providing a seamless development experience.
