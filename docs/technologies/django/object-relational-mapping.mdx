# Object-Relational Mapping

<SubHeading>Learn more about Object-Relational Mapping and RAW Selects in Django (Intro for Beginners).</SubHeading>

[Django's Object-Relational Mapping](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/db/queries/) (`ORM`) is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with your database using Python code, 
without writing SQL queries directly. 

It abstracts the database and provides a high-level, Pythonic way of managing and querying data.

> Here's a **comprehensive introduction to Django ORM**, along with samples and a brief introduction to raw **SQL selects**.

## âœ… **Setting up Models**

In Django, models represent your application's data structure. They are defined in Python and automatically generate the database schema. Here's an example of defining a simple model:

```python
from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    publication_date = models.DateField()
```

## âœ… **Creating Tables**

After defining your models, you need to create database tables. Run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

This will create the necessary tables in your database.

## âœ… **Querying with Django ORM**

Django ORM provides a rich API for querying the database. Here are some common queries:

>  **Filtering**

```python
# Retrieve all books with 'Django' in the title
books = Book.objects.filter(title__icontains='Django')
```

> **Joins**

```python
# Retrieve books with their author's name
books_with_author = Book.objects.select_related('author')
```

> **Aggregation**

```python
from django.db.models import Count
# Count the number of books by each author
author_book_count = Author.objects.annotate(num_books=Count('book'))
```

> **Sorting**

```python
# Sort books by publication date in descending order
books = Book.objects.order_by('-publication_date')
```

> **Inserting Data**

```python
new_author = Author.objects.create(name='J.K. Rowling')
new_book = Book.objects.create(title='Harry Potter', author=new_author, publication_date='1997-06-26')
```

> **Updating Data**

```python
book = Book.objects.get(title='Harry Potter')
book.title = 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone'
book.save()
```

> **Deleting Data**

```python
book = Book.objects.get(title='Harry Potter')
book.delete()
```

## âœ… **Using Raw SQL Queries**

While Django ORM is excellent for most tasks, there may be cases where you need to execute raw SQL queries. You can use the `connection` object for this purpose. For example:

```python
from django.db import connection

def custom_sql_query():
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM myapp_book WHERE title = %s", ['Harry Potter'])
        results = cursor.fetchall()
    return results
```

Remember to use raw SQL sparingly, as it bypasses Django's security features and may make your code less portable.

## âœ… In Summary

These are the basics of Django ORM and using raw SQL queries in Django. It's a powerful tool that can make database interactions in your web application more manageable and Pythonic.
