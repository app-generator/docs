# Multitenancy in Django

<SubHeading>The concept of Multitenancy in Django</SubHeading>

**Multitenancy can be implemented in Django**, a popular Python web framework, using various techniques and approaches. 
Django provides a flexible environment that allows you to design and build multitenant applications.

> Here are some common methods for `implementing multitenancy in Django`:

## **Shared Schema Approach**

- In this approach, all tenants share the same database schema, but data is segregated using a tenant identifier in each table. This identifier associates each record with a specific tenant.
- You can implement this approach using a middleware component that adds a `tenant_id` to each query based on the current tenant's context.
- Libraries like `django-tenant-schemas` provide tools to manage shared-schema multitenancy.

## **Isolated Schema Approach**

- Each tenant has its own database schema. This approach ensures complete data isolation between tenants, but it can be more resource-intensive.
- Django allows you to set up multiple database connections in your settings, and you can dynamically switch between them based on the current tenant.
- Libraries like `django-tenants` help with managing isolated-schema multitenancy.

## **Dynamic Routing Approach**

- With this approach, you dynamically choose the database connection based on the current tenant during the request processing.
- You can create custom middleware or decorators to switch between database connections for different tenants.

Here's a basic example of implementing multitenancy in Django using the shared schema approach:

```python
# Middleware to set the current tenant based on the request
class TenantMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        # Determine the current tenant based on the request (e.g., subdomain, header, etc.)
        tenant = get_tenant_from_request(request)
        
        # Set the current tenant for this request
        set_current_tenant(request, tenant)
        
        response = self.get_response(request)
        return response

# Custom manager for models to filter records by tenant
class TenantModelManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        # Filter records by the current tenant
        return super().get_queryset().filter(tenant=get_current_tenant())

# Sample model using the custom manager
class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    tenant = models.ForeignKey(Tenant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    
    # Attach the custom manager
    objects = TenantModelManager()

# Example usage in a view
def my_view(request):
    # Query the model for records of the current tenant
    data = MyModel.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'template.html', {'data': data})
```

## âœ… In Summary

This is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you'd need to handle database routing, migrations, and security considerations more carefully. 
Depending on your specific requirements, you may choose a shared schema or isolated schema approach and implement the necessary components to make multitenancy work in your Django application. 

Libraries and packages like `django-tenant-schemas` and `django-tenants` can simplify many of the tasks involved in implementing multitenancy in Django.
