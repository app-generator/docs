# Deploy Django on Azure

<SubHeading color="#25c2a0">How to deploy Django to Azure</SubHeading>

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that allows you to run your applications and store your data in the cloud instead of on your local computer. It provides a range of services such as virtual machines, databases, and storage that can be easily accessed and managed through a web-based portal. With Azure, you can quickly scale up or down depending on your needs and only pay for what you use, making it a cost-effective solution for businesses of all sizes.

## `Azure` Account Creation

Microsoft Azure offers a 30-day free trial for new users, with $200 of free credit to use on any Azure service. You will have access to all Azure services during the trial, and can upgrade to a paid plan afterwards

1. Go to the Azure website ([https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/)).
2. Click on the "Free account" button on the top right corner of the page then click "Start free".
3. Sign in to your Microsoft account or create one if you don't have account.
4. You'll be prompted to set up your free account. Fill in the required information, such as your name, email, address, country/region, and phone number
5. Choose either "Text me" or "Call me" to receive your verification code. Enter the code and click "Verify code".
6. Check the "I agree to the customer agreement" then click "Next".
7. After verifying your identity, you'll be asked to provide your credit card information. Don't worry, this is just to verify your identity and you won't be charged anything unless you upgrade to a paid account.
8. Once you've entered your credit card information, you'll be taken to the Azure dashboard. Congratulations, you've created an Azure account!

## `Azure` Creating a VM

1. Sign in to your Azure portal.
2. Select "Virtual machines" under "Azure services" or search it using the search bar.
3. In the "Instance details" section, you'll need to provide some information about your virtual machine, such as the name, region, operating system, and size. For this tutorial, we will use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS instance
4. Under "Administrator account", select SSH public key, enter the username and the key pair name.
5. Allow the HTTP and HTTPS traffic, under the "Inbound port rules", select "Allow selected ports" then select "HTTP (80)", "HTTPS (443)", and "SSH (22)" from the drop-down.
6. Leave the remaining defaults then go to "Review + create" tab.
7. If everything looks good, click on the "Create" button to create your virtual machine.
8. Azure will start provisioning your virtual machine, which may take a few minutes.
9. Don't forget to download the private key when the Generate new key pair window opens

The Ubuntu command will be used in the next steps since this instance is running on Ubuntu. If you are using a different operating system, adjust the command according to your OS.  Once your virtual machine is ready, you can connect to it using remote desktop or SSH.

## `Azure` Connect to VM

In this tutorial, we will connect to our instance using SSH and generated private key.

1. Open terminal on your local computer, this tutorial will use Ubuntu as operating system.

2. Change permission of your private key with this following command.

   ```bash
   chmod 400 /path/to/yourkey/myKey.pem
   ```

3. If you don't have SSH client on your computer, install it by running this command.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install openssh-client
   ```

4. Connect to your instance through SSH.

   ```bash
   ssh -i /path/to/youkey/myKey.pem <username>@<publicIP>
   ```

## The project to be deployed

Source project: https://github.com/app-generator/deploy-azure-django

If `git` isn't installed, run following command to install it.

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

Then clone the project by running this command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/app-generator/deploy-azure-django
```

## `Azure` Database set up

You only need to choose one of these databases, either PostgreSQL or MySQL.

### PostgreSQL

1. Install PostgreSQL in your instance

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install postgresql
   ```

2. Start the service

   Once the installation is complete, PostgreSQL will be automatically running. Otherwise, use the following command to start the service.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start postgresql
   ```

3. Login to PostgreSQL

   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres psql
   ```

4. Create database

   ```postgresql
   CREATE DATABASE appseed_db;
   ```

   Replace `appseed_db` with the name that you want.

5. Create a user and grant permission to the user.

   For this demo, we'll grant all permissions to all tables for the created user.

   ```postgresql
   CREATE USER appseed_db_usr WITH PASSWORD 'pass';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE appseed_db TO appseed_db_usr;
   ```

   Replace `appseed_db` with your database name, `appseed_db_usr` and `pass` with your desired username and password.

6. Exit PostgreSQL

   ```postgresql
   \q
   ```

### MySQL

1. Install MySQL in your instance

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev
   ```

2. Start the service

   Once the installation is complete, MySQL will be automatically running. Otherwise, use the following command to start the service.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mysql
   ```

3. Login to MySQL

   ```bash
   sudo mysql
   ```

4. Create database

   ```mysql
   CREATE DATABASE appseed_db;
   ```

   Replace `appseed_db` with the name that you want.

5. Create user and grant permission to the user.

   For this demo, we'll grant all permissions to all tables for the created user.

   ```mysql
   CREATE USER 'appseed_db_usr'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON appseed_db.* TO 'appseed_db_usr'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

   Replace `appseed_db` with your database name, `appseed_db_usr` and `pass` with your desired username and password.

6. Exit MySQL

   ```mysql
   exit
   ```

## `Azure` Environment set up

We need to set up the instance for Python environment. To find the right version to use, you need to check the Django version. If the version is not set in `requirements.txt`, it means the latest version. In Django documentation, we can found the compatible Python version.

> Django 4.2 supports Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.

### Setting up Python

First, we need to install Python, pip, and virtualenv if they aren't already installed. Use the following commands to install them.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-virtualenv
```

Verify the installation with the following command.

```bash
python3 --version
pip --version
```

### Setting up virtual environment and dependencies

Enter the project directory, create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies, and activate it using the following commands.

```bash
cd deploy-azure-django
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Now you can install packages or dependencies without affecting other projects.

For installing the dependencies, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open `requirements.txt` file using a text editor, such as nano or vim.

2. Uncomment the package following the database you used by deleting the `#` in front of it.

   - `psycopg2-binary`: for PostgreSQL
   - `mysqlclient`: for MySQL

3. Save and exit, then install the packages.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Setting up environment variables

Before moving on to the next steps, we need to set up environment variables so that the app can connect to the database and complete the setup.

1. Copy the `env.sample` file to `.env`.

   ```bash
   cp env.sample .env
   ```

2. Open `.env` file using a text editor, such as nano or vim.

3. Remove comment from database variables and fill it by following your database configuration.

   - For PostgreSQL:

     ```
     DB_ENGINE=postgresql
     DB_PORT=5432
     ```

   - For MySQL:

     ```
     DB_ENGINE=mysql
     DB_PORT=3306
     ```

4. Fill out the other variables as needed, then save the file.

### Setting up database

Run the following commands to set up your database.

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Running the app

You're all set up! You can now run the app using the following command.

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Note that your project is currently only accessible locally.

## `Azure` Domain settings

This demo use a domain that already been connected to Cloudflare. 

### Adding DNS record in Cloudflare

First, we need to add a DNS record in Cloudflare to connect the domain to our Azure instance. Follow these steps:

1. Add an `A` record.
2. In the `Name` field, enter `@` for the domain or anything else if you want to use a subdomain.
3. In the `IPv4 address` field, enter the Public IP address of the instance. You can find this in Azure > Services > Compute > EC2 > Instances (running).
4. Turn the `Proxy status` on.
5. Click 'Save'.

### Setting up reverse proxy using NGINX

Next, we need to set up a reverse proxy to point the domain to our app.

1. Install NGINX in your instance.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install nginx
   ```

2. Start the NGINX service using the following command.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start nginx
   ```

3. Set up a server block by creating a new configuration file

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain
   ```

   Replace `your_domain` with your domain name.

   Paste this following config into the file. Don't forget to replace `your_domain` with your domain name.

   ```
   server {
   	listen 80;
   	listen [::]:80;
   	
   	server_name your_domain;
   	
   	location / {
   		proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
   		proxy_set_header Host $host;
   		proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
   		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
   	}
   }
   ```

4. Enable the new config by creating a symbolic link to the `site-enabled` directory.

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
   ```

5. Remove the default config by unlinking it.

   ```bash
   sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
   ```

6. Check your configuration by running this command.

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

7. If there are no problems or errors, restart NGINX to apply the new config.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

### Allowing access to your domain

Finally, we need to allow access to our domain in our Django settings. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `core/settings.py` file in your project. 

2. Search `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and add your domain and Public IP address into it. For example:

   ```py
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your_domain', 'Public IP address']
   ```

3. Save the file.


## `Azure` SSL certificates

This demo will use SSL certificate from Cloudflare. You can also use [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=ubuntufocal&tab=standard) as an alternative.

### Creating an SSL certificate in Cloudflare

1. Navigate to SSL/TLS > Origin Server in Cloudflare. 
2. Click on "Create Certificate".
3. Keep the default config then click on "Create".
4. You will have the Origin Certificate and Private Key. We will use this in the server.

### Editing the NGINX config

1. Create a new file in `/etc/ssl/certs`, paste the **Origin Certificate** into it, and save.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssl/certs/cloudflare.pem
   ```

2. Create a new file in `/etc/ssl/private`, paste the **Private Key** into it, and save.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssl/private/cloudflare.key
   ```

3. Edit the NGINX config.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain
   ```

   Add this config below the existing config. Replace `your_domain` with your domain name.

   ```
   server {
       listen 443 ssl http2;
       listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
       ssl_certificate         /etc/ssl/certs/cloudflare.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key     /etc/ssl/private/cloudflare.pem;
   
       server_name your_domain;
   
       location / {
   		proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
   		proxy_set_header Host $host;
   		proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
   		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
   	}
   }
   ```

4. Check your configuration by running this command.

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

5. If there are no problems, restart NGINX to apply this config.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

### Changing the SSL/TLS encryption mode in Cloudflare

Finally, change the SSL/TLS encryption mode to **Full (strict)** in the Overview tab of the SSL/TLS section in the Cloudflare dashboard. This tells Cloudflare to always encrypt the communication between Cloudflare and the NGINX server at your source. 

## `Azure` CI/CD from Github

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a process that automates the building, testing, and deployment of software. In this tutorial, we will set up CI/CD from Github to our Azure instance.

### Setting up SSH Keys and Secrets

Before creating Github Action, we need to set up the Github secrets. The key pair generated in the instance creation process will be used.

1. Open your repository on Github. Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.
2. Click on "New repository secret" to add a secret. You need to add these following secrets:
   - HOST: Public IP address of instance
   - USERNAME: instance username
   - KEY: private key, from `-----BEGIN` until end of the key. Find your key pair with the `.pem` extension.
   - PORT: 22

### Setting up CI/CD with Github Action

After setting up the SSH keys and secrets, we can move the next steps:

1. Create a new folder `.github/workflows` in the project.
2. Create a new file `cd.yml` in the `.github/workflows`, paste this following code.

```yaml
name: Django CI/CD Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deployment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # according to your os
    steps:
      - name: executing remote ssh commands using ssh key
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
          key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
          port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
          script: |
            cd ~/deploy-azure-django
            git pull origin main
            env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
            env/bin/python manage.py migrate
```

3. Save the file then commit and push it to the repository.

Now, every time you push code to the `main` branch on Github, it will automatically deploy to your Azure instance.

## `Azure` LIVE Service monitoring

We'll use UptimeRobot to monitor the app. UptimeRobot is a popular online service that monitors the uptime and performance of websites, servers, and other online services.

Go to [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) create an account or sign in if you already have account. Create monitor by clicking "Add New Monitor" button then follow this config:

- Monitor Type: HTTP(s)
- Friendly Name: django-Azure (or anything else you want)
- URL (or IP): your_domain

Keep the rest of the config as default and click "Create Monitor"

UptimeRobot will now start monitoring your app. You can view the monitor status and performance data on the UptimeRobot dashboard
