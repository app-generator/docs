# Deploying Django project on PythonAnywhere

## Description

Deploying a Django project on PythonAnywhere is a lot like running a Django project on your own PC. You'll use a virtualenv, just like you probably do on your own PC, you'll have a copy of your code on PythonAnywhere which you can edit and browse and commit to version control.

The main thing that's different is that, instead of using the Django dev server with manage.py runserver and viewing your site on localhost, you'll create what we call a Web app via the Web tab in our UI, and then configure it with a WSGI file whose job is simply to import your Django project.

###  Here's an overview of the steps involved.

   - Upload your code to PythonAnywhere
   - Set up a virtualenv and install Django and any other requirements
   - Set up your web app using the manual config option
   - Add any other setup (static files, environment variables etc)

# Uploading your code to PythonAnywhere

```
git clone https://github.com/app-generator/deploy-pythonanywhere-django.git
```

# Create a virtualenv and install Django and any other requirements

```
$ mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.8 venv
(venv)$ pip install django
 or, if you have a requirements.txt:
(venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Setting up your Web app 

At this point, you need to be armed with 3 pieces of information:

The path to your Django project's top folder -- the folder that contains "manage.py", eg /home/myusername/mysite
The name of your project (that's the name of the folder that contains your settings.py), eg mysite
The name of your virtualenv, eg mysite-virtualenv


### Create a Web app with Manual Config

NOTE: Make sure you choose Manual Configuration, not the "Django" option, that's for new projects only.

### Enter your virtualenv name

Once that's done, enter the name of your virtualenv in the Virtualenv section on the web tab and click OK.

![virtualenv create](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/virtualenv_screenshot.png)

You can just use its short name "mysite-virtualenv", and it will automatically complete to its full path in /home/username/.virtualenvs.


### Optional: enter path to your code

Although this isn't necessary for the app to work, you can optionally set your working directory and give yourself a convenient hyperlink to your source files from the web tab.

Enter the path to your project folder in the Code section on the web tab, eg /home/myusername/mysite in Source code and Working directory

# Edit your WSGI file
One thing that's important here: your Django project (if you're using a recent version of Django) will have a file inside it called wsgi.py. This is not the one you need to change to set things up on PythonAnywhere -- the system here ignores that file.

Instead, the WSGI file to change is the one that has a link inside the "Code" section of the Web tab -- it will have a name something like /var/www/yourusername_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py or /var/www/www_yourdomain_com_wsgi.py.

Click on the WSGI file link, and it will take you to an editor where you can change it.

Delete everything except the Django section and then uncomment that section. Your WSGI file should look something like this:
```python

# +++++++++++ DJANGO +++++++++++
# To use your own Django app use code like this:
import os
import sys

# assuming your Django settings file is at '/home/myusername/mysite/mysite/settings.py'
path = '/home/myusername/mysite'
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, path)

os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'mysite.settings'

## Uncomment the lines below depending on your Django version
###### then, for Django >=1.5:
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
application = get_wsgi_application()
###### or, for older Django <=1.4
#import django.core.handlers.wsgi
#application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()
```
    -Be sure to substitute the correct path to your project, the folder that contains manage.py, which you noted above.
    -Don't forget to substitute in your own username too!
    -Also make sure you put the correct value for DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE.
    -This guide assumes you're using a recent version of Django, so leave the old wsgi.WSGIHandler() code commented out, or better still, delete it.
Save the file, then go and hit the Reload button for your domain. (You'll find one at the top right of the wsgi file editor, or you can go back to the main web tab)

# Database setup

If, like most sites, your site uses a database, you'll need to set that up. Go to the Consoles tab, start a bash console, use cd to navigate to the directory where your Django project's manage.py lives, then run

```
./manage.py migrate
```
