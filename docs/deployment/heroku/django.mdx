# Deploy Django to HEROKU

<SubHeading color="#25c2a0">This page explains how to deploy Django on HEROKU</SubHeading>

[HEROKU](https://www.heroku.com/what) fully supports **Python-based** applications and this page explains the steps that any developer can follow and deploy their apps using a minimal configuration. 
Any **Django** project can be deployed in two ways:

- Using HEROKU UI and connect the GitHub repository 
- Using the CLI and a short sequence of commands 

Before trying to deploy a Django project, the codebase needs to be updated (settings and dependencies), in order to have a succesfull deploy.  

## Prepare Django for HEROKU  

This section explains changes we need to apply on a Django project, as required by the HEROKU platform. 

> All mentioned changes are applied to this sample project, saved on GitHub: [HEROKU & Django Starter](https://github.com/app-generator/deploy-heroku-django)

- add `django-heroku` module to the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/app-generator/deploy-heroku-django/blob/master/requirements.txt)
- add [Procfile](https://github.com/app-generator/deploy-heroku-django/blob/master/Procfile) in the root of the project
  - this file informs HEROKU where is the entry point in the Django APP 
- edit the project [settings](https://github.com/app-generator/deploy-heroku-django/blob/master/core/settings.py) to include the following snippet (at the end of the file):

```python
import django_heroku
django_heroku.settings(locals())
```

With all the above edits completed, we can use the HEROKU CLI to deploy the app

## Deploy on HEROKU via `CLI`

Once our account on HEROKU is created and we are authenticated, we can start a new deployment. 

For this demonstration, the open-source sample will be used, and of course, the first step is to clone the source code: 

> **Step #1** - Clone/download the sources: 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/deploy-heroku-django.git
$ cd deploy-heroku-django
```

<br />

> **Step #2** - Link the terminal with HEROKU account 

```bash
$ heroku login
```

This will open a new browser window where we need to confirm the deployment. 

<br />

> **Step #3** - Push the sources into HEROKU cloud 

```bash
$ git push heroku master
```

<br />

> **Step #4** - Migrate the database on the remote deployment 

```bash
$ heroku run python manage.py migrate 
```

<br />

> **Step #6** - Access the deployed app  

```bash 
$ heroku open
```

The product should be similar to the this one [Django Material Kit](https://django-material-kit.appseed-srv1.com/login/):
