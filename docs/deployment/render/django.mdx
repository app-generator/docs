# Deploy Django to Render

<SubHeading color="#25c2a0">This page explains how to deploy Django on Render</SubHeading>

[Render](https://render.com/) fully supports **Python-based** applications and this page explains the steps that any developer can follow and deploy their apps using a minimal configuration. 
Any **Django** project can be deployed in two ways:

- As a Service: the deployed app runs standalone (not connected with other services)
- As a Blueprint, where the Django App can be connected with other local services like cron, background tasks, or a React UI. 

This page covers the case when Django is deployed as a service. 

## Deploy as a Service 

To deploy **Django** as a service, the steps are: 

- Create a new Render account using GitHub
  - Using GitHub for authentication facilitates the deployment of the project from the sources directly
- Navigate to the main Dashboard 
- Create a `New Service`
- Connect a GitHub Repository. For DEMO we will use: 
  - https://github.com/app-generator/django-datta-able
- Configure the project 
  - Name 
  - Runtime: Needs to be Python 
  - Build Command
    - this is responsible to install modules, collect statics, and build DB 
  - Start Command
    - here we need to call `Gunicorn` using the `app entry point` as input  
  - Select the Instance Type 
    - For this DEMO we will use a free one 
  - Optionally, we can specify `ENV Variables`, and disable the `auto-deploy`
  - Confirm the action 
    - click on `Create Service`

The steps with the related screens, are listed below: 

### `Create new Service`

### `Connect` a GitHub `Repository`

> This demonstration uses [Datta Able Django](https://github.com/app-generator/django-admin-datta)

<br />

### `Naming the Service` 

![Render - Configure Name](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51070104/227562561-a794f42c-9d86-4192-9e94-4091ddf97e59.png)

<br />

### `Configure` the Service 

This step is quite important because we need to inform Render that our project needs Python to run, and also what should be executed before going live. 
This open-source starter combines the build set up in single file named [build.sh](https://github.com/app-generator/django-datta-able/blob/master/build.sh) responsible with the following tasks:

- Upgrade PIP (recommended to use a newer version)
- Install modules via PIP
- Collect Static 
- Migrate DB  

Another important setting is the `Start Command` that specify the entry point to be used by `Gunicorn`. For this starter, this is the value. 

`$ gunicorn core.wsgi:application`

<br />

### `Configure` the Instance

Here we have two options: Free & Paid. For this deployment, a free instance was selected.

<br />

### `Confirm` & View Deployment Logs 

Once the above set up is confirmed, Render will create a new page for the sevice where we can visualize the deployment logs and later, update the service settings.

<br />

### Access the `LIVE Deployment` 

At this point, the app should be up & running in the same way as [Datta Able](https://django-datta-able.appseed-srv1.com/) Deployment
