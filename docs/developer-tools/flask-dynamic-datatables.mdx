# Flask Dynamic DataTables

The tool aims to provide a powerful data table interface using the developer's minimum amount of code. 
For newcomers, Flask is a leading backend framework used to code from simple websites and APIs to complex eCommerce solutions. 

The presentation layer uses `Simple-DataTables` and Vanilla JS code to render the information.

## âœ… Tool Specs & Status

As mentioned above, the `Dynamic DataTables` tool aims to enable a powerful data table interface on top of any Flask codebase with a minimum effort. Here are the steps:

- `Define a new model` in the project (an old one can be also used)
- `Execute the database migration` to create/update the associated tables
- `Update the configuration` to enable the Dynamic Data Table service over the model
- `Start` the app
- Access the `Dynamic DataTable` provided on op of the model

For instance, if the new model managed by the Dynamic Data Table Service is called books, the associate API is exposed at `/datatb/books/`
