# Django Dynamic API

This tool aims to provide a secure, `production-ready API via DRF` (Django REST Framework) using the developer's minimum amount of code. 
For newcomers, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a leading backend framework used to code from simple websites to complex eCommerce solutions. 

[DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) (Django REST Framework) is the most popular library for developing secure API services.

## ✅ Tool Specs & Status

As mentioned above, the **Dynamic API** tool aims to enable a secured API service on top of any Django codebase with a minimum effort. Here are the steps:

- `Define a new model` in the project (an old one can be also used)
- `Execute the database migration` to create/update the associated tables
- `Update the configuration` to enable the Dynamic API over the model
- `Start the app`
- Access the `Dynamic API Service`

For instance, if the new model managed by the Dynamic API is called books, the associate API is exposed at `/api/books/`
